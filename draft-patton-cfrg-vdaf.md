--- abstract

This document describes Verifiable Distributed Aggregation Functions (VDAFs), a
family of multi-party protocols for computing aggregate statistics over user
measurements. These protocols are designed to ensure that, as long as at least
one aggregation server executes the protocol honestly, individual measurements
are never seen by any server in the clear. At the same time, VDAFs allow the
servers to detect if a malicious (or merely misconfigured) client submitted an
input that would result in the aggregate getting garbled.

# Introduction

> XXX Clean up references

> XXX Harmonize author comment convention

> XXX Finish security considerations

The ubiquity of the Internet makes it an ideal platform for measurement of
large-scale phenomena, whether public health trends or the behavior of computer
systems at scale. There is substantial overlap, however, between information
that is valuable to measure and information that users consider private.

For example, consider an application that provides health information to users.
The operator of an application might want to know which parts of their
application are used most often, as a way to guide future development of the
application.  Specific users' patterns of usage, though, could reveal sensitive
things about them, such as which users are researching a given health condition.

In many situations, the measurement collector is only interested in aggregate
statistics, e.g., which portions of an application are most used or what
fraction of people have experienced a given disease.  Thus systems that provide
aggregate statistics while protecting individual measurements can deliver the
value of the measurements while protecting users' privacy.

Most prior approaches to this problem fall under the rubric of "differential
privacy (DP)" [Dwo06]. Roughly speaking, a data aggregation system that is
differentially private ensures that the degree to which any individual
measurement influences the value of the aggregated output can be controlled.
For example, in systems like RAPPOR [EPK14], each user samples noise from a
well-known distribution and adds it to their input before submitting to the
aggregation server. The aggregation server then adds up the noisy inputs, and
because it knows the distribution from whence the noise was sampled, it can
accurately estimate the true sum with reasonable precision.

Systems like RAPPOR are easy to deploy and provide a useful privacy property
(DP). On its own, however, DP falls short of the strongest privacy property one
could hope for. Specifically, depending on the "amount" of noise a client adds
to its input, it may be possible for a curious aggregator to make a reasonable
guess of the input's true value. Indeed, the amount of noise needs to be
carefully controlled, since the more noise that is added to inputs, the less
reliable will be the estimate of the output. Thus systems employing DP
techniques alone must strike a delicate balance between privacy and utility.

The ideal goal for a privacy-preserving measurement system is that of secure
multi-party computation: No participant in the protocol should learn anything
about an individual input beyond what it can deduce from the aggregate. In this
document, we describe Verifiable Distributed Aggregation Functions (VDAFs) as a
general class of protocols that achieve this goal.

VDAF schemes achieve their privacy goal by distributing the computation of the
aggregate among a number of non-colluding aggregation servers. As long as a
subset of the servers executes the protocol honestly, VDAFs guarantee that no
input is ever visible in the clear. At the same time, VDAFs are "verifiable" in
the sense that malformed inputs that would otherwise garble the output of the
computation can be detected and removed from the set of inputs.

The cost of achieving these security properties is the need for multiple servers
to participate in the protocol, and the need to ensure they do not collude to
undermine the VDAF's privacy guarantees. However, recent implementation
experience has shown that deployment of these schemes is practical.  The Prio
system (essentially a VDAF) has been deployed in systems supporting hundreds of
millions of users: The Mozilla Origin Telemetry project [OriginTelemetry] and
the Exposure Notification Private Analytics collaboration among the Internet
Security Research Group, Google, Apple, and others [ENPA].

The VDAF abstraction laid out in {{vdaf}} represents a class of multi-party
protocols for privacy-preserving measurement proposed in the literature. These
protocols vary in their operational and security considerations, sometimes in
subtle, but consequential, ways. This document therefore has two important
goals:

 1. Specify the operational and security considerations for this class of
    protocols, including:

    1. Which communication patterns are feasible, i.e., how much interaction
       between the client and aggregation servers is feasible, how and how much
       the aggregation servers ineteract amongst themselves, and so on.
    1. What are the capabilities of a malicious coalition of servers attempting
       divulge information about client inputs.
    1. What conditions are necessary to ensure that a malicious coalition of
       clients cannot corrupt the computation.

 1. Define an abstraction boundary that provides applications, like [PPM], with
    a simple, uniform interface for accessing privacy-preserving measurement
    schemes, while also providing cryptographers with design criteria for new
    constructions.

This document also specifies two concrete VDAF schemes, each based on a protocol
from the literature.

* Prio [CGB17] is a scheme proposed by Corrigan-Gibbs and Boneh in 2017 that
  allows for the privacy-preserving computation of a variety aggregate
  statistics. The input is sharded into a sequence of additive input shares and
  distributed among the aggregation servers. Each server then adds up its inputs
  shares locally. Finally, the output is obtained by combining the servers'
  local output shares. Prio also specifies a multi-party computation for
  verifying the validity of the input shares, where validity is defined by an
  arithmetic circuit evaluated over the input.

  In {{prio3}} we describe `prio3`, a VDAF that permits the same uses cases as
  the original Prio protocol, but which is based on cryptographic techniques
  introduced later in [BBCGGI19] that result in significant performance gains.

* More recently, Boneh et al. [BBCGGI21] described a protocol for solving the
  `t`-heavy-hitters problem in a privacy-preserving manner. In this setting,
  each client holds a bit-string of length `n`, and the goal of the aggregation
  servers is to compute the set of inputs that occur at least `t` times. The
  core primitive used in their protocol is a generalization of a Distributed
  Point Function (DPF) [GI14] that allows the servers to "query" their DPF
  shares on any bit-string of length shorter than or equal to `n`. As a result
  of this query, each of the servers has an additive share of a bit indicating
  whether the string is a prefix of the client's input. The protocol also
  specifies a multi-party computation for verifying that at most one string
  among a set of candidates is a prefix of the client's input.

  In {{hits}} we describe a VDAF called `hits` that captures this functionality.

The remainder of this document is organized as follows. {{overview}} gives a
brief overview of VDAFs; {{vdaf}} defines the syntax for VDAFs; {{prio3}}
describes `prio3`; {{hits}} describes `hits`; and {{security}} enumerates the
security considerations for VDAFs.

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

Algorithms are written in Python 3. Function parameters without a type hint
implicitly have type `Bytes`, an arbitrary byte string. A fatal error in a
program (e.g., failure to parse one of the function parameters) is usually
handled by raising an exception.

Some common functionalities:

* `zeros(len: Unsigned) -> output: Bytes` returns an array of zero bytes.
  The length of `output` MUST be `len`.

* `gen_rand(len: Unsigned) -> output: Bytes` returns an array of random bytes.
  The length of `output` MUST be `len`.

* `byte(int: Unsigned) -> Byte` returns the representation of `int` as a byte.
  The value of `int` MUST be in range `[0,256)`.

# Overview {#overview}

In a private measurement system, we distinguish three types of actors: Clients,
Aggregators, and Collectors.  The overall flow of the measurement process is as
follows:

* Clients are configured with public parameters for a set of Aggregators.
* To submit an individual measurement, a Client shards the measurement into
  "input shares" and sends one input share to each Aggregator.
* The aggregators verify the validity of the input shares, producing a set of
  output shares.
    * Output shares are in one-to-one correspondence with the input shares.
    * Just as each Aggregator receives one input share of each input, at the end
      of the validation process, each aggregator holds one output share.
    * In most VDAFs, aggregators will need to exchange information among
      themselves as part of the validation process.
* Each aggregator combine the output shares across inputs in the batch to
  compute shares of the desired aggregate.
* The aggregators submit their aggregate shares to the collector, who combines
  them to obtain the aggregate result over the batch.

{: #overall-flow title="Overall data flow of a VDAF"}

Aggregators are a new class of actor relative to traditional measurement systems
where clients submit measurements to a single server.  They are critical for
both the privacy properties of the system and the correctness of the
measurements obtained.  The privacy properties of the system are assured by
non-collusion among aggregators, and aggregators are the entities that perform
validation of client inputs.  Thus clients trust aggregators not to collude and
collectors trust aggregators to properly verify client inputs.

Within the bounds of the non-collusion requirements of a given VDAF instance --
privacy requires that a subset of the Aggregators (typically just one) is honest
-- it is possible for the same entity to play more than one role.  For example,
the Collector could also act as an Aggregator, effectively using the other
Aggregators to augment a basic client-server protocol.

In this document, we describe the computations performed by the actors in this
system.  It is up to applications to arrange for the required information to be
delivered to the proper actors in the proper sequence.  In general, we assume
that all communications are confidential and mutually authenticated, with the
exception that Clients submitting measurements may be anonymous.

# Definition of VDAFs {#vdaf}

A concrete VDAF specifies the algorithms involved in evaluating the VDAF on a
single input and the algorithms involved in aggregating the outputs across
multiple evaluations into the final aggregate. This section specifies the
interfaces of these algorithms as they would be exposed to applications.

A concrete VDAF scheme specifies implementations of these algorithm. In
addition, a VDAF specifies the following constants:

* `SHARES: Unsigned` is the number of Aggregators for which the VDAF is defined.
* `ROUNDS: Unsigned` is the number of rounds of communication among the
  Aggregators before they recover output shares from a single set of input
  shares.

{: #eval-flow title="Evaluation of the VDAF on a single input. The Aggregators
communicate over a broadcast channel, illustrated by the === line. At the end of
the protocol, each Aggregator has recovered a share of the output."}

Input evaluation involves a Client and the Aggregators. The process, illustrated
in {{eval-flow}}, begins by having the Client shard its input into a sequence of
input shares and sending each input share to one of the Aggregators. The
Aggregators then interact with one another over `ROUND` rounds, where in
each round, each Aggregator produces a single outbound message. The outbound
messages are broadcast to all of the aggregators at the beginning of each round.
Eventually, each aggregator recovers a share of the output.

### Setup

Before execution of the VDAF can be begin, it is necessary to distribute
long-lived parameters to the Client and Aggregators. The long-lived parameters
are generated by the following algorithm:

* `eval_setup() -> (public_param, verify_params: Vec[Bytes])` is the randomized
  setup algorithm used to generate the public parameter used by the Clients
  (`public_param`) and the verification parameters used by the Aggregators
  (`verify_params`, note that `len(input_shares) == SHARES`). The parameters are
  generated once and reused across multiple VDAF evaluations. The verification
  parameters are secret and MUST NOT be revealed to the Clients, Collector or
  other Aggregators.

  > TODO Decide how to express arrays of fixed length with Python hints and
  > replace `Vec[Bytes]` with a suitable expression.

### Client

Clients use the public parameter to shard their input into input shares. This
process is specified by the following algorithm:

* `eval_input(public_param, input) -> input_shares: Vec[Bytes]` is the
  randomized input-distribution algorithm run by each Client. It consumes the
  public parameter and input measurement and produces a sequence of input
  shares, one for each Aggregator (i.e., `len(input_shares) == SHARES`).

### Aggregator

Upon receiving their input shares from the Client, the Aggregators choose an
aggregation parameter and evaluate their input shares by interacting with one
another, eventually recovering output shares. This process is captured by the
`EvalState` object.

* `EvalState(verify_param, agg_param, nonce, input_share)` is the deterministic
  evaluation-state initialization algorithm run by each Aggregator to begin
  evaluation. Its inputs are the aggregator's verification parameter
  (`verify_param`), the aggregation parameter (`agg_param`), the nonce provided
  by the environment (`nonce`, see {{run-vdaf}}), and one of the input shares
  generated by the client (`input_share`). Its outputs is the Aggregator's
  initial evaluation state.

* `EvalState.next(inbound: Vec[Bytes]) -> outbound` is the deterministic
  evaluation-state update algorithm run by each Aggregator. It updates the
  Aggregator's evaluation state (an instance of `EvalState`) and returns either
  its outbound message for the current round or, if this is the last round, its
  output share. An exception is raised if a valid output share could not be
  recovered. The input of this algorithm is the sequence of inbound messages
  from the previous round (i.e., `len(inbound) == SHARES`) or, if this is the
  first round, an empty vector.

The evaluation-state update accomplishes two tasks that are essential to most
schemes: recovery of output shares from the input shares, and a multi-party
computation carried out by the Aggregators to ensure that their output shares
are valid. The VDAF abstraction boundary is drawn so that an Aggregator only
recovers an output shares if the output share is deemed valid (at least, based
on the Aggregator's view of the protocol). Another way to draw this boundary
woulds be to have the Aggregators recover output shares first, then verify that
they are valid. The problem is that this allows the possibility of misusing the
API by, say, aggregating an invalid output share. Moreover, in some protocols, like
Prio+ [AGJOP21] it is necessary for the Aggregators to interact in order to
recover output shares at all.

Note that it is possible for a VDAF to specify `ROUNDS == 0`, in which case
each Aggregator runs the evaluation-state update algorithm once and immediately
recovers its output share without interacting with the other Aggregators.
However, most, if not all, constructions will require some amount of interaction
in order to ensure validity of the output shares (while also maintaining
privacy).

~~~~
{: #agg-flow title="Aggregation of output shares. Each set of wires
entering from the left represent output shares recovered by the aggregators
by evaluating the VDAF on a set of input shares."}

Output aggregation involves the Aggregators and the Collector. This process,
illustrated in {{agg-flow}} runs concurrently with the input evaluation process.
Once an aggregator has recovered a valid output share, it adds it into its
long-running aggregation state locally; and once all of the inputs have been
processed, each Aggregator sends its aggregate share to the Collector, who
combines them to recover the final aggregate.

### Aggregator

> XXX Add agg parameter to constructor and update prio3 accordingly.

Each Aggregator's state is captured by the `AggState` object, which consists of
the following methods:

* `AggState()` is the deterministic aggregation-state initialization algorithm.
  It is run by each Aggregator before processing any Client input.

* `AggState.next(output_share)` is the deterministic aggregation-state update
  algorithm. It is run by an Aggregator immediately after it recovers a valid
  output share `output_share`.

### Collector

After the Aggregators have aggregated a sufficient number of output shares, each
sends its aggregate share to the collector, who runs the following algorithm to
recover the following output:

* `agg_output(agg_states: Vec[AggStates]) -> agg` is run by the Collector in
  order to compute the final aggregate from the Aggregators' aggregation states.
  (Note that `len(agg_states) == SHARES`.) This algorithm is deterministic.

## Execution of a VDAF {#execution}

Executing a VDAF involves the concurrent evaluation of the VDAF on individual
inputs and aggregation of the recovered output shares. This is captured by the
following algorithm:

~~~
def run_vdaf(agg_param, nonces: Vec[Bytes], inputs: Vec[Bytes]):
  # Distribute long-lived evaluation parameters.
  (public_param, verify_params) = eval_setup()

  # Each aggregator initializes its aggregation state.
  agg_states = [ AggState() for j in range(SHARES) ]

  for (nonce, input) in zip(nonces, inputs):
    # Each client shards its input into shares.
    input_shares = eval_input(public_param, input)

    # Each aggregator initializes its evaluation state.
    eval_states = []
    for j in range(SHARES):
      eval_states.append(EvalState(
          verify_params[j], agg_param, nonce, input_shares[j]))

    # Aggregators recover their output shares.
    inbound = []
    for i in range(ROUNDS+1):
      outbound = []
      for j in range(SHARES):
        outbound.append(eval_states[j].next(inbound))
      # This is where we would send messages over the network in a distributed
      # implementation
      inbound = outbound

    # Each aggregator updates its aggregation state.
    for j in range(SHARES):
      agg_states[j].next(outbound[j])

  # Collector unshards the aggregate.
  return agg_output(agg_states)
~~~
{: #run-vdaf title="Execution of a VDAF."}

The inputs to this algorithm are the aggregation parameter `agg_param`, a list
of nonces `nonces`, and a list of Client inputs `inputs`. The aggregation
parameter is chosen by the aggregators prior to executing the VDAF. This
document does not specify how the nonces are chosen, but some of our security
considerations require that the nonces be unique for each VDAF evaluation. See
{{security}} for details.

Another important question this document leaves out of scope is how a VDAF is to
be executed by aggregators distributed over a real network. Algorithm `run_vdaf`
prescribes the protocol's execution in a "benign" environment in which there is
no adversary and messages are passed among the protocol participants over secure
point-to-point channels. In reality, these channels need to be instantiated by
some "wrapper protocol" that implements suitable cryptographic functionalities.
Moreover, some fraction of the aggregators (or clients) may be malicious and
diverge from their prescribed behaviors. {{security}} describes the execution of
the VDAF in various adversarial environments and what properties the wrapper
protocol needs to provide in each.

# Preliminaries {#prelim}

This section describes the cryptographic primitives that are common to the VDAFs
specified in this document.

## Key Derivation

A key-derivation scheme defines a methods for deriving symmetric keys and a
method for expanding a symmetric into an arbitrary length key stream are
required. This scheme consists of the following algorithms:

* `get_key(init_key, aux_input) -> key` derives a fresh key `key` from an
  initial `init_key` and auxiliary input `aux_input`. The length of `init_key`
  and `key` MUST be equal to `KEY_SIZE`.

* `key_stream_init(key) -> state: KeyStream` returns a key stream generator that
  is used to generate an arbitrary length stream of pseudorandom bytes. The
  length of `key` MUST be `KEY_SIZE`.

* `KeyStream.next(len: Unsigned) -> (new_state: KeyStream, output)` returns the
  next `len` bytes of the key stream and updates the key stream generator state.
  The length of the output MUST be `len`.

> TODO This functionality closely resembles what people usually think of as an
> extract-then-expand KDF, but differs somewhat in its syntax and, also, its
> required security properties. Can we get the same functionality from something
> that's more commonplace? HKDF doesn't fit the bill, unfortunately, because
> keys can only be expanded to a fairly short length. Our application requires a
> rather long key stream.

Associated types:

* `KeyStream` represents the state of the key stream generator.

Associated constants:

* `KEY_SIZE` is the size of keys for the key-derivation scheme.

## Finite Fields {#field}

In this document we only consider finite fields of the form `GF(p)` for prime
`p`. Finite field elements are represented by a type `Field` that defines binary
operators for addition and multiplication in the field. The type also defines
the following associated functions:

  * `Field.zeros(len: Unsigned) -> output: Vec[Field]` returns a vector of
    zeros. The length of `output` MUST be `len`.

  * `Field.rand_vec(len: Unsigned) -> output: Vec[Field]` returns a vector of
    random field elements. The length of `output` MUST be `len`.

    > NOTE In reality this would be achieved by generating a random key and
    > expanding it into a sequence of field elements using a key derivation
    > scheme. This should probably be made explicit.

  * `Field.encode_vec(data: Vec[Field]) -> encoded_data: Bytes` represents the
    input `data` as a byte string `encoded_data`.

  * `Field.decode_vec(encoded_data: Bytes) -> data: Vec[Field]` reverse
    `encoded_vec`, returning the vector of field elements encoded by
    `encoded_data`. Raises an exception if the input does not encode a valid
    vector of field elements.

### Deriving a Pseudorandom Vector

> TODO Specify the following function in terms of a key-derivation scheme. It'll
> use `key_stream_init` to create a `KeyStream` object and read from it multiple
> times.

* `expand(Field, key: Bytes, len: Unsigned) -> output: Vec[Field]` expands a key
  into a pseudorandom sequence of field elements.

### Inner product of Vectors

> TODO Specify

* `inner_product(left: Vec[Field], right: Vec[Field]) -> Field` computes the
  inner product of `left` and `right`.

# prio3 {#prio3}

> NOTE This construction has not undergone significant security analysis.

> NOTE An implementation of this VDAF can be found
> [here](https://github.com/abetterinternet/libprio-rs/blob/main/src/vdaf/prio3.rs).

This section describes a VDAF suitable for the following data aggregation task.
Each Client measurement is encoded as a vector over a finite field, and the
aggregate is computed by summing the vectors element-wise. Validity is defined
via an arithmetic circuit `C` that takes as input a vector of field elements `x`
and outputs `0` if the input is valid. Otherwise, if `C(x) != 0`, then the input
is deemed invalid. A number of useful measurement types can be defined this way:

* Simples statistics, like sum, average, and standard deviation.
* Estimation of quantiles, via a histogram.
* Linear regression.

This VDAF does not have an aggregation parameter, hence the input shares are
identical to the output shares. See {{hits}} for an example of a VDAF that makes
meaningful use of the aggregation parameter.

The construction is derived from the original Prio system [CGB17], which is
defined for the same class of aggregation tasks. However, `prio3` takes
advantage of optimizations described later in [BBCGGI19] that improve
communication complexity significantly. The etymology of the term `prio3` is
that it descends from the original Prio construction. A second iteration was
deployed in the [ENPA] system, and like the VDAF described here, the ENPA system
was built from techniques introduced by [BBCGGI19]. However, was specialized for
a particular measurement type. The goal of `prio3` is to provide the same level
of generality as `prio1`.

The way `prio3` ensures privacy is quite simple: the Client shards its encoded
input vector `x` into a number of additive secret shares, one for each
Aggregator. Aggregators sum up their vector shares locally, and once enough
shares have been aggregated, each sends its share of the aggregate vector to the
Collector, who recovers the aggregate by adding up the vectors. The main problem
we have is ensuring that the input shares generated by the Client add up to a
valid input, i.e., that `C(x)=0`.

The solution introduced by [BBCGGI19] is what they call a zero-knowledge proof
system on distributed data. Viewing the Client as the prover and the Aggregators
as the (distributed) verifier, the goal is to devise a protocol by which the
Client convinces the Aggregators that they hold secret shares of a valid input,
without revealing the input itself. The core tool for accomplishing this task is
a refinement of Probabilistically Checkable Proof (PCP) systems called a Fully
Linear Proof (FLP) system.

We describe FLPs in detail below. Briefly, the Client generates a "proof" that
`C(x)=0` holds and distributes additive shares of the proof among the
Aggregators. Each Aggregator then performs a computation on its input share and
proof share locally and sends the result of that computation to the other
aggregators. Combining the results yields the result of evaluation the circuit
`C` on input `x`, without leaking the value of `x` itself.

`prio3` can be viewed as a transformation of a particular class of FLP systems
into a VDAF. The next section describes FLPs. The construction is given in
{{prio3-construction}}.

## Fully Linear Proof (FLP) Systems {#flp}

Conceptually, an FLP system is a two-party protocol executed by a prover and a
verifier. In actual use, however, the prover's computation is carried out by the
Client, and the verifier's computation is distributed among the Aggregators.
(More on this in {{prio3-construction}}. An FLP specifies the following
algorithms:

* `flp_prove(input: Vec[Field], prove_rand: Vec[Field], joint_rand: Vec[Field])
  -> proof: Vec[Field]` is the deterministic proof-generation algorithm run by
  the prover. Its inputs are the encoded input, the "prover randomness"
  `prove_rand`, and the "joint randomness" `joint_rand`. The proof randomness is
  used only by the prover; the joint randomness is shared by both the prover and
  verifier. Type `Field` is a finite field as defined in {{field}}.

* `flp_query(input: Vec[Field], proof: Vec[Field], query_rand: Vec[Field],
  joint_rand: Vec[Field]) -> verifier: Vec[Field]` is the query-generation
  algorithm run by the verifier. This is is used to "query" the input and proof.
  The result of the query (i.e., the output of this function) is called the
  "verifier message". In addition to the input and proof, this algorithm takes
  as input the query randomness `query_rand` and the joint randomness
  `joint_rand`.  The former is used only by the verifier and the latter is the
  same randomness used by the prover.

* `flp_decide(verifier: Vec[Field]) -> decision: Boolean` is the deterministic
  decision algorithm run by the verifier. It takes as input the verifier message
  and outputs a boolean indicating if the input from whence it was generated is
  valid.

A concrete FLP defines the following constants:

* `JOINT_RAND_LEN: Unsigned` is the length of the joint randomness in number of
  field elements.
* `PROVE_RAND_LEN: Unsigned` is the length of the prover randomness.
* `QUERY_RAND_LEN: Unsigned` is the length of the query randomness.
* `INPUT_LEN: Unsigned` is the length of the input.
* `OUTPUT_LEN: Unsigned` is the length of the aggregable output.
* `PROOF_LEN: Unsigned` is the length of the proof.
* `VERIFIER_LEN: Unsigned` is the length of the verifier message.

Our application requires that the FLP is "fully linear" in the sense defined in
[BBCGGI19]. As a practical matter, what this property implies is that the
query-generation algorithm can be run by each aggregator locally on its share of
the input and proof, and the results can be combined to recover the verifier
message. In the remainder, the result generated by an aggregator will be
referred to as its "verifier share".

Note that [BBCGGI19] defines a much larger class of fully linear proof systems;
what is called a FLP here is called a 1.5-round, public-coin, interactive oracle
proof system in their paper.

An FLP is executed by the prover and verifier as follows:

~~~
def run_flp(input, joint_rand, prove_rand, query_rand: Vec[Field]):
  assert(len(joint_rand, JOINT_RAND_LEN))
  assert(len(prove_rand, PROVE_RAND_LEN))
  assert(len(query_rand, QUERY_RAND_LEN))

  # Prover generates the proof.
  proof = flp_prove(input, prove_rand, joint_rand)

  # Verifier queries the input and proof.
  verifier = flp_query(input, proof, query_rand, joint_rand)

  # Verifier decides if the input is valid.
  return flp_decide(verifier)
~~~
{: #run-flp title="Execution of an FLP."}

The proof system is constructed so that, if `input` is a valid input, then
`run_flp(input, joint_rand, prove_rand, query_rand)` always returns `True`. On
the other hand, if `input` is invalid, then as long as `joint_rand` and
`query_rand` are generated uniform randomly, the output is `False` with
overwhelming probability. In addition, the proof system is designed so that the
verifier message leaks nothing about the input (in an information theoretic
sense). See Definition 3.9 from [BBCGGI19] for details.

An FLP is typically constructed from an arithmetic circuit, which defines
validity. However, in the remainder we do not explicitly mention this circuit
and allow validity to be defined by the set of inputs recognized by the FLP.

Finally, the FLP requires a method for encoding raw measurements as vectors of
field elements:

* `flp_encode(measurement: Bytes) -> input: Vec[Field]` encodes a raw
  measurement as a vector of field elements. The returned `input` MUST be of
  length `INPUT_LEN`. An error is raised if the measurement cannot be
  represented as a valid input.

In addition, for some FLPs, the encoded input includes redundant field elements
that are useful for checking the proof, but which are not needed after the proof
has been checked. Thus the FLP defines an algorithm for truncating the input to
the length of the aggregated output:

* `flp_truncate(input: Vec[Field]) -> output: Vec[Field]` maps an encoded input
  to an aggregable output. The length of the input MUST be `INPUT_LEN` and the
  length of the output MUST be `OUTPUT_LEN`.

Note that, taken together, these two functionalities correspond roughly to the
notion of Affine-aggregatable encodings (AFEs) from [CGB17].)

## Construction {#prio3-construction}

This VDAF involves a single round of communication (`ROUNDS == 1`). It is defined
for at least two Aggregators, but at most 255 (`2 <= SHARES <= 255`).

### Input Evaluation

#### Setup

The setup algorithm generates a symmetric key shared by all of the aggregators.
The key is used to derive unique joint randomness for the FLP query-generation
algorithm run by the aggregators during input evaluation.

~~~
def eval_setup():
  k_query_init = gen_rand(KEY_SIZE)
  verify_param = [ (j, k_query_init) for j in range(SHARES) ]
  return (None, verify_param)
~~~
{: #prio3-eval-setup title="The setup algorithm for prio3."}

#### Client

Recall that the syntax for FLP systems calls for "joint randomness" shared by
the prover (i.e., the Client) and the verifier (i.e., the Aggregators). VDAFs
have no such notion, of course. Instead, the Client will derive the joint
randomness from its input in a way that allows the Aggregators to reconstruct
the joint randomness from their input shares. (Note that this idea is adapted
from Section 6.2.3 of [BBCGGI19].)

The input-distribution algorithm involves the following steps:

1. Encode the Client's raw measurement as an input for the FLP
1. Shard the input into a sequence of input shares.
1. Derive the joint randomness from the input shares.
1. Run the FLP proof-generation algorithm using prover randomness generated
   locally.
1. Shard the proof into a sequence of input shares.

The input and proof shares of one Aggregator -- below we call it the "leader" --
are vectors of field elements. For shares of the other aggregators -- below we
call them the "helpers" -- as constant-sized symmetric keys. This is
accomplished by mapping the key to a key stream and expanding the key stream
into a pseudorandom vector of field elements. In addition to the key-derivation
scheme described in {{prelim}}, this requires a helper function, called
`expand`, defined in {{prio3-helper-functions}}.

This algorithm also makes use of a pair of helper functions for encoding the
leader share and helper share. These are called `encode_leader_share` and
`encode_helper_share` respectively.

~~~
def eval_input(_, measurement):
  input = flp_input(measurement)
  k_joint_rand = zeros(SEED_SIZE)

  # Generate input shares.
  leader_input_share = input
  k_helper_input_shares = []
  k_helper_blinds = []
  k_helper_hints = []
  for j in range(SHARES-1):
    k_blind = gen_rand(KEY_SIZE)
    k_share = gen_rand(KEY_SIZE)
    helper_input_share = expand(Field, k_share, INPUT_LEN)
    leader_input_share -= helper_input_share
    k_hint = get_key(k_blind,
        byte(j+1) + encode_vec(helper_input_share))

  # Finish joint randomness hints.
  for j in range(SHARES-1):
    k_helper_hints[i] ^= k_joint_rand
  k_leader_hint ^= k_joint_rand

  # Generate the proof shares.
  joint_rand = expand(Field, k_joint_rand, JOINT_RAND_LEN)
  prove_rand = expand(Field, gen_rand(KEY_SIZE), PROVE_RAND_LEN)
  leader_proof_share = flp_prove(input, prove_rand, joint_rand)
  k_helper_proof_shares = []
  for j in range(SHARES-1):
    k_share = gen_rand(KEY_SIZE)
    k_helper_proof_shares.append(k_share)
    helper_proof_share = expand(Field, k_share, PROOF_LEN)
    leader_proof_share -= helper_proof_share

  output = []
  output.append(encode_leader_share(
    leader_input_share,
    leader_proof_share,
    k_leader_blind,
    k_leader_hint,
  ))
  for j in range(SHARES-1):
    output.append(encode_helper_share(
      k_helper_input_share[j],
      k_helper_proof_share[j],
      k_helper_blinds[j],
      k_helper_hints[j],
    ))
  return output
~~~
{: #prio3-eval-input title="Input-distribution algorithm for prio3."}

#### Aggregator

The high level idea is that each of the Aggregators runs the FLP
query-generation algorithm on its share of the input and proof and exchange
shares of the verifier message. Once they've done that, each runs the FLP
decision algorithm on the verifier message locally to decide whether to accept.

In addition, the Aggregators must ensure that they have all used the same joint
randomness for the query-generation algorithm. The joint randomness is
generated by a symmetric key. Each Aggregator derives an XOR secret share of
this key from its input share and "blind" generated by the client. Before it can
run the query-generation algorithm, it must first gather the XOR secret shares
derived by the other Aggregators.

So that the Aggregators can avoid an extra round of communication, the client
sends each Aggregator a "hint" equal to the XOR of the other Aggregators' shares
of the joint randomness key. However, this leaves open the possibility that the
client cheated by, say, forcing the Aggregators to use joint randomness biases
the proof check procedure in someway in its favor. To mitigate this, the
Aggregators also check that they have all computed the same joint randomness key
before accepting their output shares.

> We'll need to understand better how this impacts security.

The `EvalState` type is defined as follows. It involves two additional helper
functions, `encode_verifer_share` and `decode_verifier_share`, both of which are
defined in {{prio3-helper-functions}}.

# hits {#hits}

This section specifies `hits`, a VDAF for the following task. Each Client holds
a `DIM`-bit string and the Aggregators hold a set of `l`-bit strings, where `l
<= DIM`. We will refer to the latter as the set of "candidate prefixes". The
Aggregators' goal is to count how many inputs are prefixed by each candidate
prefix.

This functionality is the core component of the privacy-preserving
`t`-heavy-hitters protocol of [BBCGGI21]. At a high level, the protocol works as
follows.

1. Each Clients runs the input-distribution algorithm on its `n`-bit string and
   sends an input share to each Aggregator.
2. The Aggregators agree on an initial set of candidate prefixes, say `0` and
   `1`.
3. The Aggregators evaluate the VDAF on each set of input shares and aggregate
   the recovered output shares. The aggregation parameter is the set of
   candidate prefixes.
4. The Aggregators send their aggregate shares to the Collector, who combines
   them to recover the counts of each candidate prefix.
5. Let `H` denote the set of prefixes that occurred at least `t` times. If the
   prefixes all have length `DIM`, then `H` is the set of `t`-heavy-hitters.
   Otherwise compute the next set of candidate prefixes as follows. For each `p`
   in `H`, add add `p || 0` and `p || 1` to the set. Repeat step 3 with the new
   set of candidate prefixes.

`hits` is constructed from an "Incremental Distributed Point Function (IDPF)", a
primitive described by [BBCGGI21] that generalizes the notion of a Distributed
Point Function (DPF) [GI14]. Briefly, a DPF is used to distribute the
computation of a "point function", a function that evaluates to zero on every
input except at a programmable "point". The computation is distributed in such a
way that no one party knows either the point or what it evaluates to. In
contrast, an IDPF represents a path on a full binary tree from the root to one
of the leaves. It is evaluated on an "index" representing a unique node of the
tree. If the node is on the path, then function evaluates to to a non-zero
value; otherwise it evaluates to zero. This structure allows an IDPF to provide
the functionality required for the above protocol, while at the same time
ensuring a significant degree of privacy.

Our VDAF composes an IDPF with the "secure sketching" protocol of [BBCGGI21].
This protocol ensures that evaluating a set of input shares on a unique set of
candidate prefixes results in shares of a "one-hot" vector, i.e., a vector that
is zero everywhere except for one element, which is equal to one.

The name `hits` is an anagram of "hist", which is short for "histogram". It is a
nod toward the "subset histogram" problem formulated by [BBCGGI21] and for which
the `hits` VDAF is a solution.

## Incremental Distributed Point Functions (IDPFs)

> NOTE An implementation of IDPFs can be found
> [here](https://github.com/google/distributed_point_functions/).

An IDPF is defined over a domain of size `2^DIM`, where `DIM` is constant
defined by the IDPF. The Client specifies an index `alpha` and values `beta`,
one for each "level" `1 <= l <= DIM`. The key generation generates two IDPF
keys, one for each Aggregator. When evaluated at index `0 <= x < 2^l`, each
IDPF share returns an additive share of `beta[l]` if `x` is the `l`-bit prefix
of `alpha` and shares of zero otherwise.

> CP What does it mean for `x` to be the `l`-bit prefix of `alpha`? We need to

Each `beta[l]` is a pair of elements of a finite field. Each level MAY have
different field parameters. Thus a concrete IDPF specifies associated types
`Field[1]`, `Field[2]`, ..., and `Field[DIM]` defining, respectively, the field
parameters at level 1, level 2, ..., and level `DIM`.

An IDPF is comprised of the following algorithms (let type `Value[l]` denote
`(Field[l], Field[l])` for each level `l`):

* `idpf_gen(alpha: Unsigned, beta: (Value[1], ..., Value[DIM])) -> key:
  (IDPFKey, IDPFKey)` is the randomized key-generation algorithm run by the
  client. Its inputs are the index `alpha` and the values `beta`. The value of
  `alpha` MUST be in range `[0, 2^DIM)`.

* `IDPFKey.eval(l: Unsigned, x: Unsigned) -> value: Value[l])` is deterministic,
  stateless key-evaluation algorithm run by each Aggregator. It returns the
  value corresponding to index `x`. The value of `l` MUST be in `[1, DIM]` and
  the value of `x` MUST be in range `[2^(l-1), 2^l)`.

A concrete IDPF specifies a single associated constant:

* `DIM: Unsigned` is the length of each Client input.

A concrete IDPF also specifies the following associated types:

* `Field[l]` for each level `1 <= l <= DIM`. Each defines the same methods and
  associated constants as `Field` in {{prio3}}.

Note that IDPF construction of [BBCGGI21] uses one field for the inner nodes of
the tree and a different, larger field for the leaf nodes. See [BBCGGI21],
Section 4.3.

Finally, an implementation note. The interface for IPDFs specified here is
stateless, in the sense that there is no state carried between IPDF
evaluations. This is to align the IDPF syntax with the VDAF abstraction
boundary, which does not include shared evaluation state across evaluations. In
practice, of course, it will often be beneficial to expose a stateful API for
IDPFs and carry the state across evaluations.

## Construction {#hits-construction}

The VDAF involves two rounds of communication (`ROUNDS == 2`) and is defined for
two Aggregators (`SHARES == 2`).

### Input Evaluation

#### Setup

The verification parameter is a symmetric key shared by both Aggregators. This
VDAF has no public parameter.

~~~
def eval_setup():
  k_verify_init = gen_rand(KEY_SIZE)
  return (None, [(0, k_verify_init), (1, k_verify_init)])
~~~
{: #hits-eval-setup title="The setup algorithm for hits."}

#### Client

The client's input is an IDPF index, denoted `alpha`. The values are pairs of
field elements `(1, k)` where `k` is chosen at random. This random vazlue is
used as part of the secure sketching protocol of [BBCGGI21]. After evaluating
their IDPF key shares on the set of candidate prefixes, the sketching protocol
is used by the Aggregators to verify that they hold shares of a one-hot vector.
In addition, for each level of the tree, the prover generates random elements
`a`, `b`, and `c` and computes

~~~
    A = -2*a + k
    B = a*a + b - k*a + c
~~~

and sends additive shares of `a`, `b`, `c`, `A` and `B` to the Aggregators.
Putting everything together, the input-distribution algorithm is defined as
follows. Function `encode_input_share` is defined in {{hits-helper-functions}}.

~~~
def eval_input(_, alpha):
  if alpha < 2**DIM: raise ERR_INVALID_INPUT

  # Prepare IDPF values.
  beta = []
  correlation_shares_0, correlation_shares_1 = [], []
  for l in range(DIM):
    (k, a, b, c) = Field[l].rand_vec(4)

    # Construct values of the form (1, k), where k
    # is a random field element.
    beta += [(1, k)]

    # Create secret shares of correlations to aid
    # the Aggregators' computation.
    A = -2*a+k
    B = a*a + b - a * k + c
    correlation_share = Field[l].rand_vec(5)
    correlation_shares_1.append(correlation_share)
    correlation_shares_0.append(
      [a, b, c, A, B] - correlation_share)

  # Generate IDPF shares.
  (key_0, key_1) = idpf_gen(input, beta)

  output = [
    encode_input_share(key_0, correlation_shares_0),
    encode_input_share(key_1, correlation_shares_1),
  ]

  return output
~~~

> seeds as suggested in [BBCGGI21].

#### Aggregator

The aggregation parameter encodes a sequence of candidate prefixes. When an
Aggregator receives input share from the Client, it begins by evaluating its
IDPF share on candidate prefixes, recovering a pair of vectors of field
elements `data_share` and `auth_share`. The Aggregators use `auth_share` and the
correlation shares provided by the Client to verify that their `data_share`
vectors are additive shares of a one-hot vector.

      for x in self.candiate_prefixes:
        value = kdpf_key.eval(l, x)
        data_share.append(value[0])

      return Field[l].encode_vec(verifier_share_2)

    elif self.step == "sketch round 2" and len(inbound) == 2:
      verifier_2 = Field[l].decode_vec(inbound[0]) + \
                   Field[l].decode_vec(inbound[1])

      if verifier_2 != 0: raise ERR_INVALID
      return self.output_share

### Output Aggregation

#### Aggregator

~~~
class AggState:
  def __init__(agg_state):
    (_ candidate_prefixes) = decode_indexes(agg_param)
    self.share = vec_zeros(len(candidate_prefixes))

  def next(self, output_share: Vec[Field]):
    if len(output_share) != len(self.share):
      raise ERR_INVALID_INPUT
    self.share += output_share
~~~

#### Collector

~~~
def agg_output(agg_states: Vec[AggState]):
  if len(agg_states) == 0:
    raise ERR_INVALID_INPUT
  agg = vec_zeros(len(agg_states[0].share))
  for agg_state in agg_states:
    if len(agg_state.share) != len(agg):
      raise ERR_INVALID_INPUT
    agg += agg_state.share
  return agg
~~~

### Helper Functions {#hits-helper-functions}

> TODO Specify the following functionalities:

* `encode_input_share` is used to encode an input share, consisting of an IDPF
  key share and correlation shares.

* `decode_input_share` is used to decode an input share.

* `decode_indexes(encoded: Bytes) -> (l: Unsigned, indexes: Vec[Unsigned])`
  decodes a sequence of indexes, i.e., candidate indexes for IDFP evaluation.
  The value of `l` MUST be in range `[1, DIM]` and `indexes[i]` MUST be in range
  `[2^(l-1), 2^l)` for all `i`. An error is raised if `encoded` cannot be
  decoded.

# Security Considerations {#security}

> NOTE: This is a brief outline of the security considerations.  This section
> will be filled out more as the draft matures and security analyses are
> completed.

A VDAF is the core of a private measurement system, but needs to be realized
within an application.  The application will need to assure a few security
properties, for example:

* Securely provisioning clients with information about aggregators
* Configuring secure communications:
  * Confidential and authentic channels among aggregators, and
    between the aggregators and the collector
  * Confidential and aggregator-authenticated channels between clients and
    aggregators
* Enforcing the non-collusion properties required of the specific VDAF in use

In such an environment, a VDAF provides the high-level privacy property
described above: The collector learns only the aggregate measurement, and
nothing about individual measurements aside from what can be inferred from the
aggregate.  The aggregators learn neither individual measurements nor the
aggregate measurement.  The collector is assured that the aggregate statistic
accurately reflects the inputs as long as the aggregators correctly executed
their role in the VDAF.

The verification component of a VDAF bounds the degree to which malicious
clients can corrupt aggregate measurements by submitting malformed inputs.
Different VDAFs allow different checks to be done on the correctness of the
input.  These controls, however, are addressed at the level of individual
measurements, and do not prevent a malicious client from submitting multiple
valid inputs that would collectively result in an incorrect aggregate (a flavor
of Sybil attack [Dou02]).
Applications can guard against these risks by adding additional controls on
measurement submission, such as client authentication and rate limits.

VDAFs do not inherently provide differential privacy [Vad16].  The VDAF approach
to private measurement can be viewed as complementary to differential privacy,
relying on non-collusion instead of statistical noise to protect the privacy of
hte inputs.  It is possible that a future VDAF could incorporate differential
privacy features, e.g., by injecting noise at the input stage and removing it
during aggregation.
