--- abstract

This document describes Verifiable Distributed Aggregation Functions (VDAFs), a
family of multi-party protocols for computing aggregate statistics over user
measurements. These protocols are designed to ensure that, as long as at least
one aggregation server executes the protocol honestly, individual measurements
are never seen by any server in the clear. At the same time, VDAFs allow the
servers to detect if a malicious or misconfigured client submitted an
input that would result in an incorrect aggregate result.

# Introduction

The ubiquity of the Internet makes it an ideal platform for measurement of
large-scale phenomena, whether public health trends or the behavior of computer
systems at scale. There is substantial overlap, however, between information
that is valuable to measure and information that users consider private.

For example, consider an application that provides health information to users.
The operator of an application might want to know which parts of their
application are used most often, as a way to guide future development of the
application.  Specific users' patterns of usage, though, could reveal sensitive
things about them, such as which users are researching a given health condition.

In many situations, the measurement collector is only interested in aggregate
statistics, e.g., which portions of an application are most used or what
fraction of people have experienced a given disease.  Thus systems that provide
aggregate statistics while protecting individual measurements can deliver the
value of the measurements while protecting users' privacy.

Most prior approaches to this problem fall under the rubric of "differential
privacy (DP)" {{Dwo06}}. Roughly speaking, a data aggregation system that is
differentially private ensures that the degree to which any individual
measurement influences the value of the aggregate result can be precisely
controlled. For example, in systems like RAPPOR {{EPK14}}, each user samples
noise from a well-known distribution and adds it to their input before
submitting to the aggregation server. The aggregation server then adds up the
noisy inputs, and because it knows the distribution from whence the noise was
sampled, it can estimate the true sum with reasonable precision.

Differentially private systems like RAPPOR are easy to deploy and provide a
useful guarantee. On its own, however, DP falls short of the strongest privacy
property one could hope for. Specifically, depending on the "amount" of noise a
client adds to its input, it may be possible for a curious aggregator to make a
reasonable guess of the input's true value. Indeed, the more noise the clients
add, the less reliable will be the server's estimate of the output. Thus systems
employing DP techniques alone must strike a delicate balance between privacy and
utility.

The ideal goal for a privacy-preserving measurement system is that of secure
multi-party computation (MPC): No participant in the protocol should learn
anything about an individual input beyond what it can deduce from the aggregate.
In this document, we describe Verifiable Distributed Aggregation Functions
(VDAFs) as a general class of protocols that achieve this goal.

VDAF schemes achieve their privacy goal by distributing the computation of the
aggregate among a number of non-colluding aggregation servers. As long as a
subset of the servers executes the protocol honestly, VDAFs guarantee that no
input is ever accessible to any party besides the client that submitted it. At
the same time, VDAFs are "verifiable" in the sense that malformed inputs that
would otherwise garble the output of the computation can be detected and removed
from the set of input measurements.

In addition to these MPC-style security goals, VDAFs can be composed with
various mechanisms for differential privacy, thereby providing the added
assurance that the aggregate result itself does not leak too much information
about any one measurement.

> TODO(issue #94) Provide guidance for local and central DP and point to it
> here.

The cost of achieving these security properties is the need for multiple servers
to participate in the protocol, and the need to ensure they do not collude to
undermine the VDAF's privacy guarantees.  Recent implementation experience has
shown that practical challenges of coordinating multiple servers can be
overcome.  The Prio system {{CGB17}} (essentially a VDAF) has been deployed in
systems supporting hundreds of millions of users: The Mozilla Origin Telemetry
project {{OriginTelemetry}} and the Exposure Notification Private Analytics
collaboration among the Internet Security Research Group (ISRG), Google, Apple,
and others {{ENPA}}.

The VDAF abstraction laid out in {{vdaf}} represents a class of multi-party
protocols for privacy-preserving measurement proposed in the literature. These
protocols vary in their operational and security considerations, sometimes in
subtle but consequential ways. This document therefore has two important goals:

 1. Providing higher-level protocols like {{?DAP=I-D.draft-ietf-ppm-dap}} with a
    simple, uniform interface for accessing privacy-preserving measurement
    schemes, and documenting relevant operational and security bounds for that
    interface:

    1. General patterns of communications among the various actors involved in
       the system (clients, aggregation servers, and the collector of the
       aggregate result);
    1. Capabilities of a malicious coalition of servers attempting to divulge
       information about client measurements; and
    1. Conditions that are necessary to ensure that malicious clients cannot
       corrupt the computation.

 1. Providing cryptographers with design criteria that provide a clear
    deployment roadmap for new constructions.

This document also specifies two concrete VDAF schemes, each based on a protocol
from the literature.

* The aforementioned Prio system {{CGB17}} allows for the privacy-preserving
  computation of a variety aggregate statistics. The basic idea underlying Prio
  is fairly simple:
  1. Each client shards its measurement into a sequence of additive shares and
     distributes the shares among the aggregation servers.
  1. Next, each server adds up its shares locally, resulting in an additive
     share of the aggregate.
  1. Finally, the aggregation servers send their aggregate shares to the data
     collector, who combines them to obtain the aggregate result.

  The difficult part of this system is ensuring that the servers hold shares of
  a valid input, e.g., the input is an integer in a specific range. Thus Prio
  specifies a multi-party protocol for accomplishing this task.

  In {{prio3}} we describe Prio3, a VDAF that follows the same overall framework
  as the original Prio protocol, but incorporates techniques introduced in
  {{BBCGGI19}} that result in significant performance gains.

* More recently, Boneh et al. {{BBCGGI21}} described a protocol called Poplar
  for solving the `t`-heavy-hitters problem in a privacy-preserving manner. Here
  each client holds a bit-string of length `n`, and the goal of the aggregation
  servers is to compute the set of inputs that occur at least `t` times. The
  core primitive used in their protocol is a specialized Distributed Point
  Function (DPF) {{GI14}} that allows the servers to "query" their DPF shares on
  any bit-string of length shorter than or equal to `n`. As a result of this
  query, each of the servers has an additive share of a bit indicating whether
  the string is a prefix of the client's input. The protocol also specifies a
  multi-party computation for verifying that at most one string among a set of
  candidates is a prefix of the client's input.

  In {{poplar1}} we describe a VDAF called Poplar1 that implements this
  functionality.

Finally, perhaps the most complex aspect of schemes like Prio3 and Poplar1 is
the process by which the client-generated measurements are prepared for
aggregation. Because these constructions are based on secret sharing, the
servers will be required to exchange some amount of information in order to
verify the measurement is valid and can be aggregated. Depending on the
construction, this process may require multiple round trips over the network.

There are applications in which this verification step may not be necessary,
e.g., when the client's software is run a trusted execution environment. To
support these applications, this document also defines Distributed Aggregation
Functions (DAFs) as a simpler class of protocols that aim to provide the same
privacy guarantee as VDAFs but fall short of being verifiable.

> OPEN ISSUE Decide if we should give one or two example DAFs. There are natural
> variants of Prio3 and Poplar1 that might be worth describing.

The remainder of this document is organized as follows: {{overview}} gives a
brief overview of DAFs and VDAFs; {{daf}} defines the syntax for DAFs; {{vdaf}}
defines the syntax for VDAFs; {{prelim}} defines various functionalities that
are common to our constructions; {{prio3}} describes the Prio3 construction;
{{poplar1}} describes the Poplar1 construction; and {{security}} enumerates the
security considerations for VDAFs.

## Change Log

(\*) Indicates a change that breaks wire compatibility with the previous draft.

03:

* Define codepoints for (V)DAFs and use them for domain separation in Prio3 and
  Poplar1. (\*)

* Prio3: Align joint randomness computation with revised paper {{BBCGGI19}}.
  This change mitigates an attack on robustness. (\*)

  IDPFs as required for Poplar1. (See {{BBCGGI21}}, Section 4.3 for details.)

* Extend (V)DAF syntax to allow the unsharding step to take into account the
  number of measurements aggregated.

  "verification key" and "Aggregator ID".

# Conventions and Definitions

{::boilerplate bcp14-tagged}

Algorithms in this document are written in Python 3. Type hints are used to
define input and output types. A fatal error in a program (e.g., failure to
parse one of the function parameters) is usually handled by raising an
exception.

A variable with type `Bytes` is a byte string. This document defines several
byte-string constants. When comprised of printable ASCII characters, they are
written as Python 3 byte-string literals (e.g., `b'some constant string'`).

A global constant `VERSION` of type `Unsigned` is defined, which algorithms are
free to use as desired. Its value SHALL be `3`.

This document describes algorithms for multi-party computations in which the
parties typically communicate over a network. Wherever a quantity is defined
that must be be transmitted from one party to another, this document prescribes
a particular encoding of that quantity as a byte string.

> OPEN ISSUE It might be better to not be prescriptive about how quantities are
> encoded on the wire. See issue #58.

Some common functionalities:

* `zeros(len: Unsigned) -> Bytes` returns an array of zero bytes. The length of
  `output` MUST be `len`.

* `gen_rand(len: Unsigned) -> Bytes` returns an array of random bytes. The
  length of `output` MUST be `len`.

* `byte(int: Unsigned) -> Bytes` returns the representation of `int` as a byte
  string. The value of `int` MUST be in `[0,256)`.

* `concat(parts: Vec[Bytes]) -> Bytes` returns the concatenation of the input
  byte strings, i.e., `parts[0] || ... || parts[len(parts)-1]`.

* `xor(left: Bytes, right: Bytes) -> Bytes` returns the bitwise XOR of `left`
  and `right`. An exception is raised if the inputs are not the same length.

* `I2OSP` and `OS2IP` from {{!RFC8017}}, which are used, respectively, to
  convert a non-negative integer to a byte string and convert a byte string to a
  non-negative integer.

* `next_power_of_2(n: Unsigned) -> Unsigned` returns the smallest integer
  greater than or equal to `n` that is also a power of two.

{: #overall-flow title="Overall data flow of a (V)DAF"}

In a DAF- or VDAF-based private measurement system, we distinguish three types
of actors: Clients, Aggregators, and Collectors.  The overall flow of the
measurement process is as follows:

* To submit an individual measurement, the Client shards the measurement into
  "input shares" and sends one input share to each Aggregator. We sometimes
  refer to this sequence of input shares collectively as the Client's "report".
* The Aggregators convert their input shares into "output shares".
    * Output shares are in one-to-one correspondence with the input shares.
    * Just as each Aggregator receives one input share of each input, at the end
      of this process, each aggregator holds one output share.
    * In VDAFs, Aggregators will need to exchange information among themselves
      as part of the validation process.
* Each Aggregator combines the output shares across inputs in the batch to
  compute the "aggregate share" for that batch, i.e., its share of the desired
  aggregate result.
* The Aggregators submit their aggregate shares to the Collector, who combines
  them to obtain the aggregate result over the batch.

Aggregators are a new class of actor relative to traditional measurement systems
where clients submit measurements to a single server.  They are critical for
both the privacy properties of the system and, in the case of VDAFs, the
correctness of the measurements obtained.  The privacy properties of the system
are assured by non-collusion among Aggregators, and Aggregators are the entities
that perform validation of Client measurements.  Thus clients trust Aggregators
not to collude (typically it is required that at least one Aggregator is
honest), and Collectors trust Aggregators to correctly run the protocol.

Within the bounds of the non-collusion requirements of a given (V)DAF instance,
it is possible for the same entity to play more than one role.  For example, the
Collector could also act as an Aggregator, effectively using the other
Aggregator(s) to augment a basic client-server protocol.

In this document, we describe the computations performed by the actors in this
system. It is up to the higher-level protocol making use of the (V)DAF to
arrange for the required information to be delivered to the proper actors in the
proper sequence. In general, we assume that all communications are confidential
and mutually authenticated, with the exception that Clients submitting
measurements may be anonymous.

# Definition of DAFs {#daf}

By way of a gentle introduction to VDAFs, this section describes a simpler class
of schemes called Distributed Aggregation Functions (DAFs). Unlike VDAFs, DAFs
do not provide verifiability of the computation. Clients must therefore be
trusted to compute their input shares correctly. Because of this fact, the use
of a DAF is NOT RECOMMENDED for most applications. See {{security}} for
additional discussion.

A DAF scheme is used to compute a particular "aggregation function" over a set
of measurements generated by Clients. Depending on the aggregation function, the
Collector might select an "aggregation parameter" and disseminates it to the
Aggregators. The semantics of this parameter is specific to the aggregation
function, but in general it is used to represent the set of "queries" that can
be made on the measurement set. For example, the aggregation parameter is used
to represent the candidate prefixes in Poplar1 {{poplar1}}.

Execution of a DAF has four distinct stages:

* Sharding - Each Client generates input shares from its measurement and
  distributes them among the Aggregators.
* Preparation - Each Aggregator converts each input share into an output share
  compatible with the aggregation function. This computation involves the
  aggregation parameter. In general, each aggregation parameter may result in a
  different an output share.
* Aggregation - Each Aggregator combines a sequence of output shares into its
  aggregate share and sends the aggregate share to the Collector.
* Unsharding - The Collector combines the aggregate shares into the aggregate
  result.

Sharding and Preparation are done once per measurement. Aggregation and
Unsharding are done over a batch of measurements (more precisely, over the
recovered output shares).

A concrete DAF specifies an algorithm for the computation needed in each of
these stages. The interface of each algorithm is defined in the remainder of
this section. In addition, a concrete DAF defines the associated constants and
types enumerated in the following table.

| Parameter          | Description              |
|:-------------------|:-------------------------|
| `ID`          | Algorithm identifier for this DAF. |
| `SHARES`      | Number of input shares into which each measurement is sharded |
| `Measurement` | Type of each measurement      |
| `AggParam`    | Type of aggregation parameter |
| `OutShare`    | Type of each output share     |
| `AggResult`   | Type of the aggregate result  |
{: #daf-param title="Constants and types defined by each concrete DAF."}

These types define some of the inputs and outputs of DAF methods at various
stages of the computation. Observe that only the measurements, output shares,
the aggregate result, and the aggregation parameter have an explicit type. All
other values --- in particular, the input shares and the aggregate shares ---
have type `Bytes` and are treated as opaque byte strings. This is because these
values must be transmitted between parties over a network.

> OPEN ISSUE It might be cleaner to define a type for each value, then have that
> type implement an encoding where necessary. This way each method parameter has
> a meaningful type hint. See issue#58.

Each DAF is identified by a unique, 32-bit integer `ID`. Identifiers for each
(V)DAF specified in this document are defined in {{codepoints}}.

## Sharding {#sec-daf-shard}

In order to protect the privacy of its measurements, a DAF Client shards its
measurements into a sequence of input shares. The `measurement_to_input_shares`
method is used for this purpose.

* `Daf.measurement_to_input_shares(input: Measurement) -> (Bytes, Vec[Bytes])`
  is the randomized input-distribution algorithm run by each Client. It consumes
  the measurement and produces a "public share", distributed to each of the
  Aggregators, and a corresponding sequence of input shares, one for each
  Aggregator. The length of the output vector MUST be `SHARES`.

{: #shard-flow title="The Client divides its measurement into input shares and
distributes them to the Aggregators."}

## Preparation {#sec-daf-prepare}

Once an Aggregator has received the public share and one of the input shares,
the next step is to prepare the input share for aggregation. This is
accomplished using the following algorithm:

* `Daf.prep(agg_id: Unsigned, agg_param: AggParam, public_share: Bytes,
  input_share: Bytes) -> OutShare` is the deterministic preparation algorithm.
  It takes as input the public share and one of the input shares generated by a
  Client, the Aggregator's unique identifier, and the aggregation parameter
  selected by the Collector and returns an output share.

The protocol in which the DAF is used MUST ensure that the Aggregator's
identifier is equal to the integer in range `[0, SHARES)` that matches the index
of `input_share` in the sequence of input shares output by the Client.

## Aggregation {#sec-daf-aggregate}

Once an Aggregator holds output shares for a batch of measurements (where
batches are defined by the application), it combines them into a share of the
desired aggregate result:

* `Daf.out_shares_to_agg_share(agg_param: AggParam, out_shares: Vec[OutShare])
  -> agg_share: Bytes` is the deterministic aggregation algorithm. It is run by
  each Aggregator a set of recovered output shares.

For simplicity, we have written this algorithm in a "one-shot" form, where all
output shares for a batch are provided at the same time. Many DAFs may also
support a "streaming" form, where shares are processed one at a time.

## Unsharding {#sec-daf-unshard}

After the Aggregators have aggregated a sufficient number of output shares, each
sends its aggregate share to the Collector, who runs the following algorithm to
recover the following output:

* `Daf.agg_shares_to_result(agg_param: AggParam,
  agg_shares: Vec[Bytes], num_measurements: Unsigned) -> AggResult` is
  run by the Collector in order to compute the aggregate result from
  the Aggregators' shares. The length of `agg_shares` MUST be `SHARES`.
  `num_measurements` is the number of measurements that contributed to
  each of the aggregate shares. This algorithm is deterministic.

## Execution of a DAF {#daf-execution}

Securely executing a DAF involves emulating the following procedure.

<!--
Simon Friedberger: I think this would be easier to understand (also a bit
longer) if there was an Aggregator class which behaved like an actual aggregator
but with messages being sent by calling functions.
-->
~~~
def run_daf(Daf,
            agg_param: Daf.AggParam,
            measurements: Vec[Daf.Measurement]):
    out_shares = [ [] for j in range(Daf.SHARES) ]
    for measurement in measurements:
        # Each Client shards its measurement into input shares and
        # distributes them among the Aggregators.
        (public_share, input_shares) = \
            Daf.measurement_to_input_shares(measurement)

        # Each Aggregator prepares its input share for aggregation.
        for j in range(Daf.SHARES):
            out_shares[j].append(
                Daf.prep(j, agg_param, public_share, input_shares[j]))

    # Each Aggregator aggregates its output shares into an aggregate
    # share and sends it to the Collector.
    agg_shares = []
    for j in range(Daf.SHARES):
        agg_share_j = Daf.out_shares_to_agg_share(agg_param,
                                                  out_shares[j])
        agg_shares.append(agg_share_j)

    # Collector unshards the aggregate result.
    num_measurements = len(measurements)
    agg_result = Daf.agg_shares_to_result(agg_param, agg_shares,
                                          num_measurements)
    return agg_result
~~~
{: #run-daf title="Execution of a DAF."}

The inputs to this procedure are the same as the aggregation function computed by
the DAF: An aggregation parameter and a sequence of measurements. The procedure
prescribes how a DAF is executed in a "benign" environment in which there is no
adversary and the messages are passed among the protocol participants over
secure point-to-point channels. In reality, these channels need to be
instantiated by some "wrapper protocol", such as {{?DAP=I-D.draft-ietf-ppm-dap}},
that realizes these channels using suitable cryptographic mechanisms. Moreover,
some fraction of the Aggregators (or Clients) may be malicious and diverge from
their prescribed behaviors. {{security}} describes the execution of the DAF in
various adversarial environments and what properties the wrapper protocol needs
to provide in each.

# Definition of VDAFs {#vdaf}

Like DAFs described in the previous section, a VDAF scheme is used to compute a
particular aggregation function over a set of Client-generated measurements.
Evaluation of a VDAF involves the same four stages as for DAFs: Sharding,
Preparation, Aggregation, and Unsharding. However, the Preparation stage will
require interaction among the Aggregators in order to facilitate verifiability
of the computation's correctness. Accommodating this interaction will require
syntactic changes.

Overall execution of a VDAF comprises the following stages:

* Sharding - Computing input shares from an individual measurement
* Preparation - Conversion and verification of input shares to output shares
  compatible with the aggregation function being computed
* Aggregation - Combining a sequence of output shares into an aggregate share
* Unsharding - Combining a sequence of aggregate shares into an aggregate
  result

In contrast to DAFs, the Preparation stage for VDAFs now performs an additional
task: Verification of the validity of the recovered output shares. This process
ensures that aggregating the output shares will not lead to a garbled aggregate
result.

<!--
For some VDAFs, like Prio3 ({{prio3}}) or Poplar1 ({{poplar1}}), the output
shares are recovered first, then validated. For other protocols, like Prio+
[AGJOP21], there is no explicit verification step.
-->

The remainder of this section defines the VDAF interface. The attributes are
listed in {{vdaf-param}} are defined by each concrete VDAF.

| Parameter         | Description              |
|:------------------|:-------------------------|
| `ID`              | Algorithm identifier for this VDAF |
| `VERIFY_KEY_SIZE` | Size (in bytes) of the verification key ({{sec-vdaf-prepare}}) |
| `NONCE_SIZE`    ` | Size (in bytes) of the nonce |
| `ROUNDS`          | Number of rounds of communication during the Preparation stage ({{sec-vdaf-prepare}}) |
| `SHARES`          | Number of input shares into which each measurement is sharded ({{sec-vdaf-shard}}) |
| `Measurement`     | Type of each measurement |
| `AggParam`        | Type of aggregation parameter |
| `Prep`            | State of each Aggregator during Preparation ({{sec-vdaf-prepare}}) |
| `OutShare`        | Type of each output share |
| `AggResult`       | Type of the aggregate result |
{: #vdaf-param title="Constants and types defined by each concrete VDAF."}

Similarly to DAFs (see {[sec-daf}}), any output of a VDAF method that must be
transmitted from one party to another is treated as an opaque byte string. All
other quantities are given a concrete type.

> OPEN ISSUE It might be cleaner to define a type for each value, then have that
> type implement an encoding where necessary. See issue#58.

Each VDAF is identified by a unique, 32-bit integer `ID`. Identifiers for each
(V)DAF specified in this document are defined in {{codepoints}}. The following
method is defined for every VDAF:

~~~
def custom(Vdaf, usage: Unsigned) -> Bytes:
    return format_custom(0, Vdaf.ID, usage)
~~~

It is used to construct a customization string for an instance of `Prg` used by
the VDAF. (See {{prg}}.)

## Sharding {#sec-vdaf-shard}

Sharding transforms a measurement into input shares as it does in DAFs
(cf. {{sec-daf-shard}}); in addition, it takes a nonce as input and
produces a public share:

* `Vdaf.measurement_to_input_shares(measurement: Measurement, nonce:
  Bytes[Vdaf.NONCE_SIZE]) -> (Bytes, Vec[Bytes])` is the randomized
  input-distribution algorithm run by each Client. It consumes the measurement
  and the nonce and produces a public share, distributed to each of Aggregators,
  and the corresponding sequence of input shares, one for each Aggregator.
  Depending on the VDAF, the input shares may encode additional information used
  to verify the recovered output shares (e.g., the "proof shares" in Prio3
  {{prio3}}). The length of the output vector MUST be `SHARES`.

In order to ensure privacy of the measurement, the Client MUST generate the
nonce using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator (CSPRNG).
(See {{security}} for details.)

## Preparation {#sec-vdaf-prepare}

To recover and verify output shares, the Aggregators interact with one another
over `ROUNDS` rounds. Prior to each round, each Aggregator constructs an
outbound message. Next, the sequence of outbound messages is combined into a
single message, called a "preparation message". (Each of the outbound messages
are called "preparation-message shares".) Finally, the preparation message is
distributed to the Aggregators to begin the next round.

An Aggregator begins the first round with its input share and it begins each
subsequent round with the previous preparation message. Its output in the last
round is its output share and its output in each of the preceding rounds is a
preparation-message share.

This process involves a value called the "aggregation parameter" used to map the
input shares to output shares. The Aggregators need to agree on this parameter
before they can begin preparing inputs for aggregation.

~~~~
{: #prep-flow title="VDAF preparation process on the input shares for a single
measurement. At the end of the computation, each Aggregator holds an output
share or an error."}

To facilitate the preparation process, a concrete VDAF implements the following
class methods:

* `Vdaf.prep_init(verify_key: Bytes[Vdaf.VERIFY_KEY_SIZE], agg_id: Unsigned,
  agg_param: AggParam, nonce: Bytes[Vdaf.NONCE_SIZE], public_share: Bytes,
  input_share: Bytes) -> Prep` is the deterministic preparation-state
  initialization algorithm run by each Aggregator to begin processing its input
  share into an output share. Its inputs are the shared verification key
  (`verify_key`), the Aggregator's unique identifier (`agg_id`), the aggregation
  parameter (`agg_param`), the nonce provided by the environment (`nonce`, see
  {{run-vdaf}}), the public share (`public_share`), and one of the input
  shares generated by the client (`input_share`). Its output is the Aggregator's
  initial preparation state.

  It is up to the high level protocol in which the VDAF is used to arrange for
  the distribution of the verification key among the Aggregators prior to the
  start of this phase of VDAF evaluation.

  > OPEN ISSUE What security properties do we need for this key exchange? See
  > issue#18.

  Protocols using the VDAF MUST ensure that the Aggregator's identifier is equal
  to the integer in range `[0, SHARES)` that matches the index of `input_share`
  in the sequence of input shares output by the Client.

  Protocols MUST ensure that public share consumed by each of the Aggregators is
  identical. This is security critical for VDAFs such as Poplar1 that require an
  extractable distributed point function. (See {{poplar1}} for details.)

* `Vdaf.prep_next(prep: Prep, inbound: Optional[Bytes]) -> Union[Tuple[Prep,
  Bytes], OutShare]` is the deterministic preparation-state update algorithm run
  by each Aggregator. It updates the Aggregator's preparation state (`prep`) and
  returns either its next preparation state and its message share for the
  current round or, if this is the last round, its output share. An exception is
  raised if a valid output share could not be recovered. The input of this
  algorithm is the inbound preparation message or, if this is the first round,
  `None`.

* `Vdaf.prep_shares_to_prep(agg_param: AggParam, prep_shares: Vec[Bytes]) ->
  Bytes` is the deterministic preparation-message pre-processing algorithm. It
  combines the preparation-message shares generated by the Aggregators in the
  previous round into the preparation message consumed by each in the next
  round.

In effect, each Aggregator moves through a linear state machine with `ROUNDS+1`
states.  The Aggregator enters the first state on using the initialization
algorithm, and the update algorithm advances the Aggregator to the next state.
Thus, in addition to defining the number of rounds (`ROUNDS`), a VDAF instance
defines the state of the Aggregator after each round.

> TODO Consider how to bake this "linear state machine" condition into the
> syntax. Given that Python 3 is used as our pseudocode, it's easier to specify
> the preparation state using a class.

The preparation-state update accomplishes two tasks: recovery of output shares
from the input shares and ensuring that the recovered output shares are valid.
The abstraction boundary is drawn so that an Aggregator only recovers an output
share if it is deemed valid (at least, based on the Aggregator's view of the
protocol). Another way to draw this boundary would be to have the Aggregators
recover output shares first, then verify that they are valid. However, this
would allow the possibility of misusing the API by, say, aggregating an invalid
output share. Moreover, in protocols like Prio+ {{AGJOP21}} based on oblivious
transfer, it is necessary for the Aggregators to interact in order to recover
aggregatable output shares at all.

Note that it is possible for a VDAF to specify `ROUNDS == 0`, in which case each
Aggregator runs the preparation-state update algorithm once and immediately
recovers its output share without interacting with the other Aggregators.
However, most, if not all, constructions will require some amount of interaction
in order to ensure validity of the output shares (while also maintaining
privacy).

> OPEN ISSUE accommodating 0-round VDAFs may require syntax changes if, for
> example, public keys are required. On the other hand, we could consider
> defining this class of schemes as a different primitive. See issue#77.

## Aggregation {#sec-vdaf-aggregate}

VDAF Aggregation is identical to DAF Aggregation (cf. {{sec-daf-aggregate}}):

* `Vdaf.out_shares_to_agg_share(agg_param: AggParam, out_shares: Vec[OutShare])
  -> agg_share: Bytes` is the deterministic aggregation algorithm. It is run by
  each Aggregator over the output shares it has computed over a batch of
  measurement inputs.

The data flow for this stage is illustrated in {{aggregate-flow}}. Here again,
we have the aggregation algorithm in a "one-shot" form, where all shares for a
batch are provided at the same time. VDAFs typically also support a "streaming"
form, where shares are processed one at a time.

## Unsharding {#sec-vdaf-unshard}

VDAF Unsharding is identical to DAF Unsharding (cf. {{sec-daf-unshard}}):

* `Vdaf.agg_shares_to_result(agg_param: AggParam,
  agg_shares: Vec[Bytes], num_measurements: Unsigned) -> AggResult` is
  run by the Collector in order to compute the aggregate result from
  the Aggregators' shares. The length of `agg_shares` MUST be `SHARES`.
  `num_measurements` is the number of measurements that contributed to
  each of the aggregate shares. This algorithm is deterministic.

The data flow for this stage is illustrated in {{unshard-flow}}.

## Execution of a VDAF {#vdaf-execution}

The inputs to this algorithm are the aggregation parameter, a list of
measurements, and a nonce for each measurement. This document does not specify
how the nonces are chosen, but security requires that the nonces be unique. See
{{security}} for details. As explained in {{daf-execution}}, the secure
execution of a VDAF requires the application to instantiate secure channels
between each of the protocol participants.

# Preliminaries {#prelim}

This section describes the primitives that are common to the VDAFs specified in
this document.

## Finite Fields {#field}

Both Prio3 and Poplar1 use finite fields of prime order. Finite field
elements are represented by a class `Field` with the following associated
parameters:

* `MODULUS: Unsigned` is the prime modulus that defines the field.

* `ENCODED_SIZE: Unsigned` is the number of bytes used to encode a field element
  as a byte string.

A concrete `Field` also implements the following class methods:

* `Field.zeros(length: Unsigned) -> output: Vec[Field]` returns a vector of
  zeros. The length of `output` MUST be `length`.

* `Field.rand_vec(length: Unsigned) -> output: Vec[Field]` returns a vector of
  random field elements. The length of `output` MUST be `length`.

A field element is an instance of a concrete `Field`. The concrete class defines
the usual arithmetic operations on field elements. In addition, it defines the
following instance method for converting a field element to an unsigned integer:

* `elem.as_unsigned() -> Unsigned` returns the integer representation of
  field element `elem`.

Likewise, each concrete `Field` implements a constructor for converting an
unsigned integer into a field element:

* `Field(integer: Unsigned)` returns `integer` represented as a field element.
  The value of `integer` MUST be less than `Field.MODULUS`.

Finally, each concrete `Field` has two derived class methods, one for encoding
a vector of field elements as a byte string and another for decoding a vector of
field elements.

~~~
def encode_vec(Field, data: Vec[Field]) -> Bytes:
    encoded = Bytes()
    for x in data:
        encoded += I2OSP(x.as_unsigned(), Field.ENCODED_SIZE)
    return encoded

def decode_vec(Field, encoded: Bytes) -> Vec[Field]:
    L = Field.ENCODED_SIZE
    if len(encoded) % L != 0:
        raise ERR_DECODE

    vec = []
    for i in range(0, len(encoded), L):
        encoded_x = encoded[i:i+L]
        x = OS2IP(encoded_x)
        if x >= Field.MODULUS:
            raise ERR_DECODE # Integer is larger than modulus
        vec.append(Field(x))
    return vec
~~~
{: #field-derived-methods title="Derived class methods for finite fields."}

### Auxiliary Functions

The following auxiliary functions on vectors of field elements are used in the
remainder of this document. Note that an exception is raised by each function if
the operands are not the same length.

~~~
# Compute the inner product of the operands.
def inner_product(left: Vec[Field], right: Vec[Field]) -> Field:
    return sum(map(lambda x: x[0] * x[1], zip(left, right)))

# Subtract the right operand from the left and return the result.
def vec_sub(left: Vec[Field], right: Vec[Field]):
    return list(map(lambda x: x[0] - x[1], zip(left, right)))

# Add the right operand to the left and return the result.
def vec_add(left: Vec[Field], right: Vec[Field]):
    return list(map(lambda x: x[0] + x[1], zip(left, right)))
~~~
{: #field-helper-functions title="Common functions for finite fields."}

### FFT-Friendly Fields {#field-fft-friendly}

Some VDAFs require fields that are suitable for efficient computation of the
discrete Fourier transform, as this allows for fast polynomial interpolation.
(One example is Prio3 ({{prio3}}) when instantiated with the generic FLP of
{{flp-generic-construction}}.) Specifically, a field is said to be
"FFT-friendly" if, in addition to satisfying the interface described in
{{field}}, it implements the following method:

* `Field.gen() -> Field` returns the generator of a large subgroup of the
  multiplicative group. To be FFT-friendly, the order of this subgroup NUST be a
  power of 2. In addition, the size of the subgroup dictates how large
  interpolated polynomials can be. It is RECOMMENDED that a generator is chosen
  with order at least `2^20`.

FFT-friendly fields also define the following parameter:

* `GEN_ORDER: Unsigned` is the order of a multiplicative subgroup generated by

## Pseudorandom Generators {#prg}

A pseudorandom generator (PRG) is used to expand a short, (pseudo)random seed
into a long string of pseudorandom bits. A PRG suitable for this document
implements the interface specified in this section.

PRGs are defined by a class `Prg` with the following associated parameter:

* `SEED_SIZE: Unsigned` is the size (in bytes) of a seed.

A concrete `Prg` implements the following class method:

* `Prg(seed: Bytes[Prg.SEED_SIZE], custom: Bytes, binder: Bytes)` constructs an
  instance of `Prg` from the given seed and customization and binder strings.
  (See below for definitions of these.) The seed MUST be of length `SEED_SIZE`
  and MUST be generated securely (i.e., it is either the output of `gen_rand` or
  a previous invocation of the PRG).

* `prg.next(length: Unsigned)` returns the next `length` bytes of output of PRG.
  If the seed was securely generated, the output can be treated as pseudorandom.

Each `Prg` has two derived class methods. The first is used to derive a fresh
seed from an existing one. The second is used to compute a sequence of
pseudorandom field elements. For each method, the seed MUST be of length
`SEED_SIZE` and MUST be generated securely (i.e., it is either the output of
`gen_rand` or a previous invocation of the PRG).

~~~

def derive_seed(Prg, seed: Bytes[Prg.SEED_SIZE], custom: Bytes, binder: Bytes):

    return prg.next(Prg.SEED_SIZE)

# Output the next `length` pseudorandom elements of `Field`.
def next_vec(self, Field, length: Unsigned):
    m = next_power_of_2(Field.MODULUS) - 1
    vec = []
    while len(vec) < length:
        x = OS2IP(self.next(Field.ENCODED_SIZE))
        x &= m
        if x < Field.MODULUS:
            vec.append(Field(x))
    return vec

        # stream each time `next()` is invoked, most implementations
        # of SHA-3 will expose an "absorb-then-squeeze" API that
        # allows stateful handling of the stream.
        stream = cSHAKE128(self.x, self.l, b'', self.s)
        return stream[-length:]

### The Context and Binder Strings

PRGs are used to map a seed to a finite domain, e.g., a fresh seed or a vector
of field elements. To ensure domain separation, the derivation is needs to be
bound to some distinguished "customization string". The customization string
encodes the following values:

1. The document version (i.e.,`VERSION`);
1. The "class" of the algorithm using the output (e.g., VDAF);
1. A unique identifier for the algorithm; and
1. Some indication of how the output is used (e.g., for deriving the measurement
   shares in Prio3 {{prio3}}).

The following algorithm is used in the remainder of this document in order to
format the customization string:

~~~
def format_custom(algo_class: Unsigned, algo: Unsigned, usage: Unsigned):
    return I2OSP(VERSION, 1) + \
           I2OSP(algo_class, 1) + \
           I2OSP(algo, 4) + \
           I2OSP(usage, 2)
~~~

It is also sometimes necessary to bind the output to some ephemeral value that
muliple parties need to agree on. We call this input the "binder string".

# Prio3 {#prio3}

> NOTE This construction has not undergone significant security analysis.

This section describes Prio3, a VDAF for Prio {{CGB17}}. Prio is suitable for
a wide variety of aggregation functions, including (but not limited to) sum,
mean, standard deviation, estimation of quantiles (e.g., median), and linear
regression. In fact, the scheme described in this section is compatible with any
aggregation function that has the following structure:

* Each measurement is encoded as a vector over some finite field.
* Input validity is determined by an arithmetic circuit evaluated over the
  encoded input. (An "arithmetic circuit" is a function comprised of arithmetic
  operations in the field.) The circuit's output is a single field element: if
  zero, then the input is said to be "valid"; otherwise, if the output is
  non-zero, then the input is said to be "invalid".
* The aggregate result is obtained by summing up the encoded input vectors and
  computing some function of the sum.

At a high level, Prio3 distributes this computation as follows. Each Client
first shards its measurement by first encoding it, then splitting the vector into
secret shares and sending a share to each Aggregator. Next, in the preparation
phase, the Aggregators carry out a multi-party computation to determine if their
shares correspond to a valid input (as determined by the arithmetic circuit).
This computation involves a "proof" of validity generated by the Client. Next,
each Aggregator sums up its input shares locally. Finally, the Collector sums up
the aggregate shares and computes the aggregate result.

This VDAF does not have an aggregation parameter. Instead, the output share is
derived from the input share by applying a fixed map. See {{poplar1}} for an
example of a VDAF that makes meaningful use of the aggregation parameter.

As the name implies, Prio3 is a descendant of the original Prio construction.
A second iteration was deployed in the {{ENPA}} system, and like the VDAF
described here, the ENPA system was built from techniques introduced in
{{BBCGGI19}} that significantly improve communication cost. That system was
specialized for a particular aggregation function; the goal of Prio3 is to
provide the same level of generality as the original construction.

The core component of Prio3 is a "Fully Linear Proof (FLP)" system. Introduced
by {{BBCGGI19}}, the FLP encapsulates the functionality required for encoding
and validating inputs. Prio3 can be thought of as a transformation of a
particular class of FLPs into a VDAF.

The remainder of this section is structured as follows. The syntax for FLPs is
described in {{flp}}. The generic transformation of an FLP into Prio3 is
specified in {{prio3-construction}}. Next, a concrete FLP suitable for any
validity circuit is specified in {{flp-generic}}. Finally, instantiations of
Prio3 for various types of measurements are specified in
{{prio3-instantiations}}. Test vectors can be found in {{test-vectors}}.

## Fully Linear Proof (FLP) Systems {#flp}

Conceptually, an FLP is a two-party protocol executed by a prover and a
verifier. In actual use, however, the prover's computation is carried out by the
Client, and the verifier's computation is distributed among the Aggregators. The
Client generates a "proof" of its input's validity and distributes shares of the
proof to the Aggregators. Each Aggregator then performs some a computation on
its input share and proof share locally and sends the result to the other
Aggregators. Combining the exchanged messages allows each Aggregator to decide
if it holds a share of a valid input. (See {{prio3-construction}} for details.)

As usual, we will describe the interface implemented by a concrete FLP in terms
of an abstract base class `Flp` that specifies the set of methods and parameters
a concrete FLP must provide.

The parameters provided by a concrete FLP are listed in {{flp-param}}.

| Parameter        | Description               |
|:-----------------|:--------------------------|
| `PROVE_RAND_LEN` | Length of the prover randomness, the number of random field elements consumed by the prover when generating a proof |
| `QUERY_RAND_LEN` | Length of the query randomness, the number of random field elements consumed by the verifier |
| `JOINT_RAND_LEN` | Length of the joint randomness, the number of random field elements consumed by both the prover and verifier |
| `INPUT_LEN`      | Length of the encoded measurement ({{flp-encode}}) |
| `OUTPUT_LEN`     | Length of the aggregatable output ({{flp-encode}}) |
| `PROOF_LEN`      | Length of the proof       |
| `VERIFIER_LEN`   | Length of the verifier message generated by querying the input and proof |
| `Measurement`    | Type of the measurement   |
| `AggResult`      | Type of the aggregate result |
| `Field`          | As defined in ({{field}}) |
{: #flp-param title="Constants and types defined by a concrete FLP."}

An FLP specifies the following algorithms for generating and verifying proofs of
validity (encoding is described below in {{flp-encode}}):

* `Flp.prove(input: Vec[Field], prove_rand: Vec[Field], joint_rand: Vec[Field])
  -> Vec[Field]` is the deterministic proof-generation algorithm run by the
  prover. Its inputs are the encoded input, the "prover randomness"
  `prove_rand`, and the "joint randomness" `joint_rand`. The prover randomness is
  used only by the prover, but the joint randomness is shared by both the prover
  and verifier.

* `Flp.query(input: Vec[Field], proof: Vec[Field], query_rand: Vec[Field],
  joint_rand: Vec[Field], num_shares: Unsigned) -> Vec[Field]` is the
  query-generation algorithm run by the verifier. This is used to "query" the
  input and proof. The result of the query (i.e., the output of this function)
  is called the "verifier message". In addition to the input and proof, this
  algorithm takes as input the query randomness `query_rand` and the joint
  randomness `joint_rand`. The former is used only by the verifier. `num_shares`
  specifies how many input and proof shares were generated.

* `Flp.decide(verifier: Vec[Field]) -> Bool` is the deterministic decision
  algorithm run by the verifier. It takes as input the verifier message and
  outputs a boolean indicating if the input from which it was generated is
  valid.

Our application requires that the FLP is "fully linear" in the sense defined in
{{BBCGGI19}}. As a practical matter, what this property implies is that, when
run on a share of the input and proof, the query-generation algorithm outputs a
share of the verifier message. Furthermore, the "strong zero-knowledge" property
of the FLP system ensures that the verifier message reveals nothing about the
input's validity. Therefore, to decide if an input is valid, the Aggregators
will run the query-generation algorithm locally, exchange verifier shares,
combine them to recover the verifier message, and run the decision algorithm.

The query-generation algorithm includes a parameter `num_shares` that specifies
the number of shares of the input and proof that were generated. If these data
are not secret shared, then `num_shares == 1`. This parameter is useful for
certain FLP constructions. For example, the FLP in {{flp-generic}} is defined in
terms of an arithmetic circuit; when the circuit contains constants, it is
sometimes necessary to normalize those constants to ensure that the circuit's
output, when run on a valid input, is the same regardless of the number of
shares.

An FLP is executed by the prover and verifier as follows:

~~~
def run_flp(Flp, inp: Vec[Flp.Field], num_shares: Unsigned):
    joint_rand = Flp.Field.rand_vec(Flp.JOINT_RAND_LEN)
    prove_rand = Flp.Field.rand_vec(Flp.PROVE_RAND_LEN)
    query_rand = Flp.Field.rand_vec(Flp.QUERY_RAND_LEN)

    # Prover generates the proof.
    proof = Flp.prove(inp, prove_rand, joint_rand)

    # Verifier queries the input and proof.
    verifier = Flp.query(inp, proof, query_rand, joint_rand, num_shares)

    # Verifier decides if the input is valid.
    return Flp.decide(verifier)
~~~
{: #run-flp title="Execution of an FLP."}

The proof system is constructed so that, if `input` is a valid input, then
`run_flp(Flp, input, 1)` always returns `True`. On the other hand, if `input` is
invalid, then as long as `joint_rand` and `query_rand` are generated uniform
randomly, the output is `False` with overwhelming probability.

We remark that {{BBCGGI19}} defines a much larger class of fully linear proof
systems than we consider here. In particular, what is called an "FLP" here is
called a 1.5-round, public-coin, interactive oracle proof system in their paper.

### Encoding the Input {#flp-encode}

The type of measurement being aggregated is defined by the FLP. Hence, the FLP
also specifies a method of encoding raw measurements as a vector of field
elements:

* `Flp.encode(measurement: Measurement) -> Vec[Field]` encodes a raw measurement
  as a vector of field elements. The return value MUST be of length `INPUT_LEN`.

For some FLPs, the encoded input also includes redundant field elements that are
useful for checking the proof, but which are not needed after the proof has been
checked. An example is the "integer sum" data type from {{CGB17}} in which an
integer in range `[0, 2^k)` is encoded as a vector of `k` field elements (this
type is also defined in {{prio3sum}}). After consuming this vector, all that is
needed is the integer it represents. Thus the FLP defines an algorithm for
truncating the input to the length of the aggregated output:

* `Flp.truncate(input: Vec[Field]) -> Vec[Field]` maps an encoded input to an
  aggregatable output. The length of the input MUST be `INPUT_LEN` and the length
  of the output MUST be `OUTPUT_LEN`.

Once the aggregate shares have been computed and combined together, their sum
can be converted into the aggregate result. This could be a projection from
the FLP's field to the integers, or it could include additional
post-processing.

* `Flp.decode(output: Vec[Field], num_measurements: Unsigned) -> AggResult`
  maps a sum of aggregate shares to an aggregate result. The length of the
  input MUST be `OUTPUT_LEN`. `num_measurements` is the number of measurements
  that contributed to the aggregated output.

We remark that, taken together, these three functionalities correspond roughly
to the notion of "Affine-aggregatable encodings (AFEs)" from {{CGB17}}.

## Construction {#prio3-construction}

This section specifies `Prio3`, an implementation of the `Vdaf` interface
({{vdaf}}). It has two generic parameters: an `Flp` ({{flp}}) and a `Prg`
({{prg}}). The associated constants and types required by the `Vdaf` interface
are defined in {{prio3-param}}. The methods required for sharding, preparation,
aggregation, and unsharding are described in the remaining subsections. These
methods refer to constants enumerated in {{prio3-const}}.

| `DST_JOINT_RAND_PART: Unsigned`   | 7     |
{: #prio3-const title="Constants used by Prio3."}

### Sharding

Recall from {{flp}} that the FLP syntax calls for "joint randomness" shared by
the prover (i.e., the Client) and the verifier (i.e., the Aggregators). VDAFs
have no such notion. Instead, the Client derives the joint randomness from its
input in a way that allows the Aggregators to reconstruct it from their input
shares. (This idea is based on the Fiat-Shamir heuristic and is described in
Section 6.2.3 of {{BBCGGI19}}.)

The input-distribution algorithm involves the following steps:

1. Encode the Client's raw measurement as an input for the FLP
1. Shard the input into a sequence of input shares
1. Derive the joint randomness from the input shares and nonce
1. Run the FLP proof-generation algorithm using the derived joint randomness
1. Shard the proof into a sequence of proof shares

The algorithm is specified below. Notice that only one set of input and proof
shares (called the "leader" shares below) are vectors of field elements. The
other shares (called the "helper" shares) are represented instead by PRG seeds,
which are expanded into vectors of field elements.

The definitions of constants and a few auxiliary functions are defined in
{{prio3-auxiliary}}.

### Preparation

This section describes the process of recovering output shares from the input
shares. The high-level idea is that each Aggregator first queries its input and
proof share locally, then exchanges its verifier share with the other
Aggregators. The verifier shares are then combined into the verifier message,
which is used to decide whether to accept.

In addition, the Aggregators must ensure that they have all used the same joint
randomness for the query-generation algorithm. The joint randomness is generated
by a PRG seed. Each Aggregator derives a "part" of this seed from its input
share and the "blind" generated by the client. The seed is derived by hashing
together the parts, so before running the query-generation algorithm, it must
first gather the parts derived by the other Aggregators.

In order to avoid extra round of communication, the Client sends each Aggregator
a "hint" consisting of the other Aggregators' parts of the joint randomness
seed. This leaves open the possibility that the Client cheated by, say, forcing
the Aggregators to use joint randomness that biases the proof check procedure
some way in its favor. To mitigate this, the Aggregators also check that they
have all computed the same joint randomness seed before accepting their output
shares. To do so, they exchange their parts of the joint randomness along with
their verifier shares.

The definitions of constants and a few auxiliary functions are defined in
{{prio3-auxiliary}}.

## A General-Purpose FLP {#flp-generic}

This section describes an FLP based on the construction from in {{BBCGGI19}},
Section 4.2. We begin in {{flp-generic-overview}} with an overview of their proof
system and the extensions to their proof system made here. The construction is
specified in {{flp-generic-construction}}.

### Overview {#flp-generic-overview}

In the proof system of {{BBCGGI19}}, validity is defined via an arithmetic
circuit evaluated over the input: If the circuit output is zero, then the input
is deemed valid; otherwise, if the circuit output is non-zero, then the input is
deemed invalid. Thus the goal of the proof system is merely to allow the
verifier to evaluate the validity circuit over the input. For our application
({{prio3}}), this computation is distributed among multiple Aggregators, each of
which has only a share of the input.

Suppose for a moment that the validity circuit `C` is affine, meaning its only
operations are addition and multiplication-by-constant. In particular, suppose
the circuit does not contain a multiplication gate whose operands are both
non-constant. Then to decide if an input `x` is valid, each Aggregator could
evaluate `C` on its share of `x` locally, broadcast the output share to its
peers, then combine the output shares locally to recover `C(x)`. This is true
because for any `SHARES`-way secret sharing of `x` it holds that

~~~
C(x_shares[0] + ... + x_shares[SHARES-1]) =
    C(x_shares[0]) + ... + C(x_shares[SHARES-1])
~~~

(Note that, for this equality to hold, it may be necessary to scale any
constants in the circuit by `SHARES`.) However this is not the case if `C` is
not-affine (i.e., it contains at least one multiplication gate whose operands
are non-constant). In the proof system of {{BBCGGI19}}, the proof is designed to
allow the (distributed) verifier to compute the non-affine operations using only
linear operations on (its share of) the input and proof.

To make this work, the proof system is restricted to validity circuits that
exhibit a special structure. Specifically, an arithmetic circuit with "G-gates"
(see {{BBCGGI19}}, Definition 5.2) is composed of affine gates and any number of
instances of a distinguished gate `G`, which may be non-affine. We will refer to
this class of circuits as 'gadget circuits' and to `G` as the "gadget".

As an illustrative example, consider a validity circuit `C` that recognizes the
set `L = set([0], [1])`. That is, `C` takes as input a length-1 vector `x` and
returns 0 if `x[0]` is in `[0,2)` and outputs something else otherwise. This
circuit can be expressed as the following degree-2 polynomial:

~~~
C(x) = (x[0] - 1) * x[0] = x[0]^2 - x[0]
~~~

This polynomial recognizes `L` because `x[0]^2 = x[0]` is only true if `x[0] ==
0` or `x[0] == 1`. Notice that the polynomial involves a non-affine operation,
`x[0]^2`. In order to apply {{BBCGGI19}}, Theorem 4.3, the circuit needs to be
rewritten in terms of a gadget that subsumes this non-affine operation. For
example, the gadget might be multiplication:

~~~
Mul(left, right) = left * right
~~~

The validity circuit can then be rewritten in terms of `Mul` like so:

~~~
C(x[0]) = Mul(x[0], x[0]) - x[0]
~~~

The proof system of {{BBCGGI19}} allows the verifier to evaluate each instance
of the gadget (i.e., `Mul(x[0], x[0])` in our example) using a linear function
of the input and proof. The proof is constructed roughly as follows. Let `C` be
the validity circuit and suppose the gadget is arity-`L` (i.e., it has `L` input
wires.). Let `wire[j-1,k-1]` denote the value of the `j`th wire of the `k`th
call to the gadget during the evaluation of `C(x)`. Suppose there are `M` such
calls and fix distinct field elements `alpha[0], ..., alpha[M-1]`. (We will
require these points to have a special property, as we'll discuss in
{{flp-generic-overview-extensions}}; but for the moment it is only important
that they are distinct.)

The prover constructs from `wire` and `alpha` a polynomial that, when evaluated
at `alpha[k-1]`, produces the output of the `k`th call to the gadget. Let us
call this the "gadget polynomial". Polynomial evaluation is linear, which means
that, in the distributed setting, the Client can disseminate additive shares of
the gadget polynomial that the Aggregators then use to compute additive shares
of each gadget output, allowing each Aggregator to compute its share of `C(x)`
locally.

There is one more wrinkle, however: It is still possible for a malicious prover
to produce a gadget polynomial that would result in `C(x)` being computed
incorrectly, potentially resulting in an invalid input being accepted. To
prevent this, the verifier performs a probabilistic test to check that the
gadget polynomial is well-formed. This test, and the procedure for constructing
the gadget polynomial, are described in detail in {{flp-generic-construction}}.

#### Extensions {#flp-generic-overview-extensions}

The FLP described in the next section extends the proof system {{BBCGGI19}},
Section 4.2 in three ways.

First, the validity circuit in our construction includes an additional, random
input (this is the "joint randomness" derived from the input shares in Prio3;
see {{prio3-construction}}). This allows for circuit optimizations that trade a
small soundness error for a shorter proof. For example, consider a circuit that
recognizes the set of length-`N` vectors for which each element is either one or
zero. A deterministic circuit could be constructed for this language, but it
would involve a large number of multiplications that would result in a large
proof. (See the discussion in {{BBCGGI19}}, Section 5.2 for details). A much
shorter proof can be constructed for the following randomized circuit:

~~~
C(inp, r) = r * Range2(inp[0]) + ... + r^N * Range2(inp[N-1])
~~~

(Note that this is a special case of {{BBCGGI19}}, Theorem 5.2.) Here `inp` is
the length-`N` input and `r` is a random field element. The gadget circuit
`Range2` is the "range-check" polynomial described above, i.e., `Range2(x) = x^2 -
x`. The idea is that, if `inp` is valid (i.e., each `inp[j]` is in `[0,2)`),
then the circuit will evaluate to 0 regardless of the value of `r`; but if
`inp[j]` is not in `[0,2)` for some `j`, the output will be non-zero with high
probability.

The second extension implemented by our FLP allows the validity circuit to
contain multiple gadget types. (This generalization was suggested in
{{BBCGGI19}}, Remark 4.5.) For example, the following circuit is allowed, where
`Mul` and `Range2` are the gadgets defined above (the input has length `N+1`):

~~~
C(inp, r) = r * Range2(inp[0]) + ... + r^N * Range2(inp[N-1]) + \
            2^0 * inp[0]       + ... + 2^(N-1) * inp[N-1]     - \
            Mul(inp[N], inp[N])
~~~

Finally, {{BBCGGI19}}, Theorem 4.3 makes no restrictions on the choice of the
fixed points `alpha[0], ..., alpha[M-1]`, other than to require that the points
are distinct. In this document, the fixed points are chosen so that the gadget
polynomial can be constructed efficiently using the Cooley-Tukey FFT ("Fast
Fourier Transform") algorithm. Note that this requires the field to be
"FFT-friendly" as defined in {{field-fft-friendly}}.

### Validity Circuits {#flp-generic-valid}

The FLP described in {{flp-generic-construction}} is defined in terms of a
validity circuit `Valid` that implements the interface described here.

A concrete `Valid` defines the following parameters:

| Parameter      | Description                           |
|:---------------|:--------------------------------------|
| `GADGETS`      | A list of gadgets                     |
| `GADGET_CALLS` | Number of times each gadget is called |
| `INPUT_LEN`    | Length of the input                   |
| `OUTPUT_LEN`   | Length of the aggregatable output     |
| `JOINT_RAND_LEN` | Length of the random input          |
| `Measurement`  | The type of measurement               |
| `AggResult`    | Type of the aggregate result          |
| `Field`        | An FFT-friendly finite field as defined in {{field-fft-friendly}} |
{: title="Validity circuit parameters."}

Each gadget `G` in `GADGETS` defines a constant `DEGREE` that specifies the
circuit's "arithmetic degree". This is defined to be the degree of the
polynomial that computes it. For example, the `Mul` circuit in
{{flp-generic-overview}} is defined by the polynomial `Mul(x) = x * x`, which
has degree `2`. Hence, the arithmetic degree of this gadget is `2`.

Each gadget also defines a parameter `ARITY` that specifies the circuit's arity
(i.e., the number of input wires).

A concrete `Valid` provides the following methods for encoding a measurement as
an input vector, truncating an input vector to the length of an aggregatable
output, and converting an aggregated output to an aggregate result:

* `Valid.encode(measurement: Measurement) -> Vec[Field]` returns a vector of
  length `INPUT_LEN` representing a measurement.

* `Valid.truncate(input: Vec[Field]) -> Vec[Field]` returns a vector of length
  `OUTPUT_LEN` representing an aggregatable output.

* `Valid.decode(output: Vec[Field], num_measurements: Unsigned) -> AggResult`
  returns an aggregate result.

Finally, the following class methods are derived for each concrete `Valid`:

~~~
# Length of the prover randomness.
def prove_rand_len(Valid):
    return sum(map(lambda g: g.ARITY, Valid.GADGETS))

# Length of the query randomness.
def query_rand_len(Valid):
    return len(Valid.GADGETS)

# Length of the proof.
def proof_len(Valid):
    length = 0
    for (g, g_calls) in zip(Valid.GADGETS, Valid.GADGET_CALLS):
        P = next_power_of_2(1 + g_calls)
        length += g.ARITY + g.DEGREE * (P - 1) + 1
    return length

# Length of the verifier message.
def verifier_len(Valid):
    length = 1
    for g in Valid.GADGETS:
        length += g.ARITY + 1
    return length
~~~
{: title="Derived methods for validity circuits."}

### Construction {#flp-generic-construction}

This section specifies `FlpGeneric`, an implementation of the `Flp` interface
({{flp}}). It has as a generic parameter a validity circuit `Valid` implementing
the interface defined in {{flp-generic-valid}}.

> NOTE A reference implementation can be found in
> https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf/blob/main/poc/flp_generic.sage.

The FLP parameters for `FlpGeneric` are defined in {{flp-generic-param}}. The
required methods for generating the proof, generating the verifier, and deciding
validity are specified in the remaining subsections.

In the remainder, we let `[n]` denote the set `{1, ..., n}` for positive integer
`n`. We also define the following constants:

* Let `H = len(Valid.GADGETS)`
* For each `i` in `[H]`:
    * Let `G_i = Valid.GADGETS[i]`
    * Let `L_i = Valid.GADGETS[i].ARITY`
    * Let `M_i = Valid.GADGET_CALLS[i]`
    * Let `P_i = next_power_of_2(M_i+1)`
    * Let `alpha_i = Field.gen()^(Field.GEN_ORDER / P_i)`

| Parameter        | Value               |
|:-----------------|:--------------------|
| `PROVE_RAND_LEN` | `Valid.prove_rand_len()` (see {{flp-generic-valid}}) |
| `QUERY_RAND_LEN` | `Valid.query_rand_len()` (see {{flp-generic-valid}}) |
| `JOINT_RAND_LEN` | `Valid.JOINT_RAND_LEN` |
| `INPUT_LEN`      | `Valid.INPUT_LEN`   |
| `OUTPUT_LEN`     | `Valid.OUTPUT_LEN`  |
| `PROOF_LEN`      | `Valid.proof_len()` (see {{flp-generic-valid}}) |
| `VERIFIER_LEN`   | `Valid.verifier_len()` (see {{flp-generic-valid}}) |
| `Measurement`    | `Valid.Measurement` |
| `Field`          | `Valid.Field`       |
{: #flp-generic-param title="FLP Parameters of FlpGeneric."}

#### Proof Generation {#flp-generic-construction-prove}

On input `inp`, `prove_rand`, and `joint_rand`, the proof is computed as
follows:

1. For each `i` in `[H]` create an empty table `wire_i`.

1. Partition the prover randomness `prove_rand` into subvectors `seed_1, ...,
   seed_H` where `len(seed_i) == L_i` for all `i` in `[H]`. Let us call these
   the "wire seeds" of each gadget.

1. Evaluate `Valid` on input of `inp` and `joint_rand`, recording the inputs of
   each gadget in the corresponding table. Specifically, for every `i` in `[H]`,
   set `wire_i[j-1,k-1]` to the value on the `j`th wire into the `k`th call to
   gadget `G_i`.

1. Compute the "wire polynomials". That is, for every `i` in `[H]` and `j` in
   `[L_i]`, construct `poly_wire_i[j-1]`, the `j`th wire polynomial for the
   `i`th gadget, as follows:

    * Let `w = [seed_i[j-1], wire_i[j-1,0], ..., wire_i[j-1,M_i-1]]`.

    * Let `padded_w = w + Field.zeros(P_i - len(w))`.

    > NOTE We pad `w` to the nearest power of 2 so that we can use FFT for
    > interpolating the wire polynomials. Perhaps there is some clever math for
    > picking `wire_inp` in a way that avoids having to pad.

    * Let `poly_wire_i[j-1]` be the lowest degree polynomial for which
      `poly_wire_i[j-1](alpha_i^k) == padded_w[k]` for all `k` in `[P_i]`.

1. Compute the "gadget polynomials". That is, for every `i` in `[H]`:

    * Let `poly_gadget_i = G_i(poly_wire_i[0], ..., poly_wire_i[L_i-1])`. That
      is, evaluate the circuit `G_i` on the wire polynomials for the `i`th
      gadget. (Arithmetic is in the ring of polynomials over `Field`.)

The proof is the vector `proof = seed_1 + coeff_1 + ... + seed_H + coeff_H`,
where `coeff_i` is the vector of coefficients of `poly_gadget_i` for each `i` in
`[H]`.

#### Query Generation {#flp-generic-construction-query}

On input of `inp`, `proof`, `query_rand`, and `joint_rand`, the verifier message
is generated as follows:

1. For every `i` in `[H]` create an empty table `wire_i`.

1. Partition `proof` into the subvectors `seed_1`, `coeff_1`, ..., `seed_H`,
   `coeff_H` defined in {{flp-generic-construction-prove}}.

1. Evaluate `Valid` on input of `inp` and `joint_rand`, recording the inputs of
   each gadget in the corresponding table. This step is similar to the prover's
   step (3.) except the verifier does not evaluate the gadgets. Instead, it
   computes the output of the `k`th call to `G_i` by evaluating
   `poly_gadget_i(alpha_i^k)`. Let `v` denote the output of the circuit
   evaluation.

1. Compute the wire polynomials just as in the prover's step (4.).

1. Compute the tests for well-formedness of the gadget polynomials. That is, for
   every `i` in `[H]`:

    * Let `t = query_rand[i]`. Check if `t^(P_i) == 1`: If so, then raise
      ERR_ABORT and halt. (This prevents the verifier from inadvertently leaking
      a gadget output in the verifier message.)

    * Let `y_i = poly_gadget_i(t)`.

    * For each `j` in `[0,L_i)` let `x_i[j-1] = poly_wire_i[j-1](t)`.

The verifier message is the vector `verifier = [v] + x_1 + [y_1] + ... + x_H +
[y_H]`.

#### Decision

On input of vector `verifier`, the verifier decides if the input is valid as
follows:

1. Parse `verifier` into `v`, `x_1`, `y_1`, ..., `x_H`, `y_H` as defined in
   {{flp-generic-construction-query}}.

1. Check for well-formedness of the gadget polynomials. For every `i` in `[H]`:

    * Let `z = G_i(x_i)`. That is, evaluate the circuit `G_i` on `x_i` and set
      `z` to the output.

    * If `z != y_i`, then return `False` and halt.

1. Return `True` if `v == 0` and `False` otherwise.

#### Encoding

The FLP encoding and truncation methods invoke `Valid.encode`,
`Valid.truncate`, and `Valid.decode` in the natural way.

## Instantiations {#prio3-instantiations}

This section specifies instantiations of Prio3 for various measurement types.
Each uses `FlpGeneric` as the FLP ({{flp-generic}}) and is determined by a
validity circuit ({{flp-generic-valid}}) and a PRG ({{prg}}). Test vectors for
each can be found in {{test-vectors}}.

> NOTE Reference implementations of each of these VDAFs can be found in
> https://github.com/cfrg/draft-irtf-cfrg-vdaf/blob/main/poc/vdaf_prio3.sage.

### Prio3Count

Our first instance of Prio3 is for a simple counter: Each measurement is either
one or zero and the aggregate result is the sum of the measurements.

This instance uses PrgSha3 ({{prg-sha3}) as its PRG. Its validity
circuit, denoted `Count`, uses `Field64` ({{field64}}) as its finite field. Its
gadget, denoted `Mul`, is the degree-2, arity-2 gadget defined as

~~~
def Mul(x, y):
    return x * y
~~~

The validity circuit is defined as

~~~
def Count(inp: Vec[Field64]):
    return Mul(inp[0], inp[0]) - inp[0]
~~~

The measurement is encoded and decoded as a singleton vector in the natural
way. The parameters for this circuit are summarized below.

| Parameter        | Value                        |
|:-----------------|:-----------------------------|
| `GADGETS`        | `[Mul]`                      |
| `GADGET_CALLS`   | `[1]`                        |
| `INPUT_LEN`      | `1`                          |
| `OUTPUT_LEN`     | `1`                          |
| `JOINT_RAND_LEN` | `0`                          |
| `Measurement`    | `Unsigned`, in range `[0,2)` |
| `AggResult`      | `Unsigned`                   |
| `Field`          | `Field64` ({{field64}})      |
{: title="Parameters of validity circuit Count."}

### Prio3Sum

The next instance of Prio3 supports summing of integers in a pre-determined
range. Each measurement is an integer in range `[0, 2^bits)`, where `bits` is an
associated parameter.

This instance of Prio3 uses PrgSha3 ({{prg-sha3}}) as its PRG. Its validity
circuit, denoted `Sum`, uses `Field128` ({{field128}}) as its finite field. The
measurement is encoded as a length-`bits` vector of field elements, where the
`l`th element of the vector represents the `l`th bit of the summand:

~~~
def encode(Sum, measurement: Integer):
    if 0 > measurement or measurement >= 2^Sum.INPUT_LEN:
        raise ERR_INPUT

    encoded = []
    for l in range(Sum.INPUT_LEN):
        encoded.append(Sum.Field((measurement >> l) & 1))
    return encoded

def truncate(Sum, inp):
    decoded = Sum.Field(0)
    for (l, b) in enumerate(inp):
        w = Sum.Field(1 << l)
        decoded += w * b
    return [decoded]

def decode(Sum, output, _num_measurements):
    return output[0].as_unsigned()
~~~

The validity circuit checks that the input consists of ones and zeros. Its
gadget, denoted `Range2`, is the degree-2, arity-1 gadget defined as

~~~
def Range2(x):
    return x^2 - x
~~~

The validity circuit is defined as

~~~
def Sum(inp: Vec[Field128], joint_rand: Vec[Field128]):
    out = Field128(0)
    r = joint_rand[0]
    for x in inp:
        out += r * Range2(x)
        r *= joint_rand[0]
    return out
~~~

| Parameter        | Value                        |
|:-----------------|:-----------------------------|
| `GADGETS`        | `[Range2]`                   |
| `GADGET_CALLS`   | `[bits]`                     |
| `INPUT_LEN`      | `bits`                       |
| `OUTPUT_LEN`     | `1`                          |
| `JOINT_RAND_LEN` | `1`                          |
| `Measurement`    | `Unsigned`, in range `[0, 2^bits)` |
| `AggResult`      | `Unsigned`                   |
| `Field`          | `Field128` ({{field128}})    |
{: title="Parameters of validity circuit Sum."}

### Prio3Histogram

This instance of Prio3 allows for estimating the distribution of the
measurements by computing a simple histogram. Each measurement is an arbitrary
integer and the aggregate result counts the number of measurements that fall in
a set of fixed buckets.

This instance of Prio3 uses PrgSha3 ({{prg-sha3}}) as its PRG. Its validity
circuit, denoted `Histogram`, uses `Field128` ({{field128}}) as its finite
field. The measurement is encoded as a one-hot vector representing the bucket
into which the measurement falls (let `bucket` denote a sequence of
monotonically increasing integers):

~~~
def encode(Histogram, measurement: Integer):
    boundaries = buckets + [Infinity]
    encoded = [Field128(0) for _ in range(len(boundaries))]
    for i in range(len(boundaries)):
        if measurement <= boundaries[i]:
            encoded[i] = Field128(1)
            return encoded

def truncate(Histogram, inp: Vec[Field128]):
    return inp

def decode(Histogram, output: Vec[Field128], _num_measurements):
    return [bucket_count.as_unsigned() for bucket_count in output]
~~~

The validity circuit uses `Range2` (see {{prio3sum}}) as its single gadget. It
checks for one-hotness in two steps, as follows:

~~~
def Histogram(inp: Vec[Field128],
              joint_rand: Vec[Field128],
              num_shares: Unsigned):
    # Check that each bucket is one or zero.
    range_check = Field128(0)
    r = joint_rand[0]
    for x in inp:
        range_check += r * Range2(x)
        r *= joint_rand[0]

    # Check that the buckets sum to 1.
    sum_check = -Field128(1) * Field128(num_shares).inv()
    for b in inp:
        sum_check += b

    out = joint_rand[1]   * range_check + \
          joint_rand[1]^2 * sum_check
    return out
~~~

Note that this circuit depends on the number of shares into which the input is
sharded. This is provided to the FLP by Prio3.

| Parameter        | Value                     |
|:-----------------|:--------------------------|
| `GADGETS`        | `[Range2]`                |

# Poplar1 {#poplar1}

> NOTE This construction has not undergone significant security analysis.

This section specifies Poplar1, a VDAF for the following task. Each Client holds
a string of length `BITS` and the Aggregators hold a set of `l`-bit strings,
where `l <= BITS`. We will refer to the latter as the set of "candidate
prefixes". The Aggregators' goal is to count how many inputs are prefixed by
each candidate prefix.

This functionality is the core component of the Poplar protocol {{BBCGGI21}}. At
a high level, the protocol works as follows.

1. Each Client splits its input string into input shares and sends one share to
   each Aggregator.
2. The Aggregators agree on an initial set of candidate prefixes, say `0` and
   `1`.
3. The Aggregators evaluate the VDAF on each set of input shares and aggregate
   the recovered output shares. The aggregation parameter is the set of
   candidate prefixes.
4. The Aggregators send their aggregate shares to the Collector, who combines
   them to recover the counts of each candidate prefix.
5. Let `H` denote the set of prefixes that occurred at least `t` times. If the
   prefixes all have length `BITS`, then `H` is the set of `t`-heavy-hitters.
   Otherwise compute the next set of candidate prefixes as follows. For each `p`
   in `H`, add add `p || 0` and `p || 1` to the set. Repeat step 3 with the new
   set of candidate prefixes.

Poplar1 is constructed from an "Incremental Distributed Point Function (IDPF)",
a primitive described by {{BBCGGI21}} that generalizes the notion of a
Distributed Point Function (DPF) {{GI14}}. Briefly, a DPF is used to distribute
the computation of a "point function", a function that evaluates to zero on
every input except at a programmable "point". The computation is distributed in
such a way that no one party knows either the point or what it evaluates to.

An IDPF generalizes this "point" to a path on a full binary tree from the root
to one of the leaves. It is evaluated on an "index" representing a unique node
of the tree. If the node is on the programmed path, then function evaluates to
to a non-zero value; otherwise it evaluates to zero. This structure allows an
IDPF to provide the functionality required for the above protocol, while at the
same time ensuring the same degree of privacy as a DPF.

Poplar1 composes an IDPF with the "secure sketching" protocol of {{BBCGGI21}}.
This protocol ensures that evaluating a set of input shares on a unique set of
candidate prefixes results in shares of a "one-hot" vector, i.e., a vector that
is zero everywhere except for one element, which is equal to one.

The remainder of this section is structured as follows. IDPFs are defined in
{{idpf}}; a concrete instantiation is given {{idpf-poplar}}. The Poplar1 VDAF is
defined in {{poplar1-construction}} in terms of a generic IDPF. Finally, a
concrete instantiation of Poplar1 is specified in {{poplar1-inst}};
test vectors can be found in {{test-vectors}}.

## Incremental Distributed Point Functions (IDPFs) {#idpf}

An IDPF is defined over a domain of size `2^BITS`, where `BITS` is constant
defined by the IDPF. Indexes into the IDPF tree are encoded as integers in range
`[0, 2^BITS)`. The Client specifies an index `alpha` and a vector of
values `beta`, one for each "level" `L` in range `[0, BITS)`. The key generation
algorithm generates one IDPF "key" for each Aggregator. When evaluated at level
`L` and index `0 <= prefix < 2^L`, each IDPF key returns an additive share of
`beta[L]` if `prefix` is the `L`-bit prefix of `alpha` and shares of zero
otherwise.

An index `x` is defined to be a prefix of another index `y` as follows. Let
`LSB(x, N)` denote the least significant `N` bits of positive integer `x`. By
definition, a positive integer `0 <= x < 2^L` is said to be the length-`L`
prefix of positive integer `0 <= y < 2^BITS` if `LSB(x, L)` is equal to the most
significant `L` bits of `LSB(y, BITS)`, For example, 6 (110 in binary) is the
length-3 prefix of 25 (11001), but 7 (111) is not.

Each of the programmed points `beta` is a vector of elements of some finite
field. We distinguish two types of fields: One for inner nodes (denoted
`Idpf.FieldInner`), and one for leaf nodes (`Idpf.FieldLeaf`). (Our
instantiation of Poplar1 ({{poplar1-inst}}) will use a much larger field for
leaf nodes than for inner nodes. This is to ensure the IDPF is "extractable" as
defined in {{BBCGGI21}}, Definition 1.)

A concrete IDPF defines the types and constants enumerated in {{idpf-param}}. In
the remainder we write `Idpf.Vec` as shorthand for the type
`Union[Vec[Vec[Idpf.FieldInner]], Vec[Vec[Idpf.FieldLeaf]]]`. (This type denotes
either a vector of inner node field elements or leaf node field elements.) The
scheme is comprised of the following algorithms:

* `Idpf.gen(alpha: Unsigned, beta_inner: Vec[Vec[Idpf.FieldInner]], beta_leaf:
  Vec[Idpf.FieldLeaf]) -> (Bytes, Vec[Bytes])` is the randomized IDPF-key
  generation algorithm. Its inputs are the index `alpha` and the values `beta`.
  The value of `alpha` MUST be in range `[0, 2^BITS)`. The output is a public
  part that is sent to all Aggregators and a vector of private IDPF keys, one
  for each aggregator.

* `Idpf.eval(agg_id: Unsigned, public_share: Bytes, key: Bytes, level: Unsigned,
  prefixes: Vec[Unsigned]) -> Idpf.Vec` is the deterministic, stateless
  IDPF-key evaluation algorithm run by each Aggregator. Its inputs are the
  Aggregator's unique identifier, the public share distributed to all of the
  Aggregators, the Aggregator's IDPF key, the "level" at which to evaluate the
  IDPF, and the sequence of candidate prefixes. It returns the share of the
  value corresponding to each candidate prefix.

  The output type depends on the value of `level`: If `level < Idpf.BITS-1`, the
  output is the value for an inner node, which has type
  `Vec[Vec[Idpf.FieldInner]]`; otherwise, if `level == Idpf.BITS-1`, then the
  output is the value for a leaf node, which has type
  `Vec[Vec[Idpf.FieldLeaf]]`.

  The value of `level` MUST be in range `[0, BITS)`. The indexes in `prefixes`
  MUST all be distinct and in range `[0, 2^level)`.

  Applications MUST ensure that the Aggregator's identifier is equal to the
  integer in range `[0, SHARES)` that matches the index of `key` in the sequence
  of IDPF keys output by the Client.

In addition, the following method is derived for each concrete `Idpf`:

~~~
def current_field(Idpf, level):
    return Idpf.FieldInner if level < Idpf.BITS-1 \
                else Idpf.FieldLeaf
~~~

Finally, an implementation note. The interface for IDPFs specified here is
stateless, in the sense that there is no state carried between IDPF evaluations.
This is to align the IDPF syntax with the VDAF abstraction boundary, which does
not include shared state across across VDAF evaluations. In practice, of course,
it will often be beneficial to expose a stateful API for IDPFs and carry the
state across evaluations. See {{idpf-poplar}} for details.

This section specifies `Poplar1`, an implementation of the `Vdaf` interface
({{vdaf}}). It is defined in terms of any `Idpf` ({{idpf}}) for which
`Idpf.SHARES == 2` and `Idpf.VALUE_LEN == 2`. The associated constants and types
required by the `Vdaf` interface are defined in {{poplar1-param}}. The methods
required for sharding, preparation, aggregation, and unsharding are described in
the remaining subsections. These methods make use of constants defined in
{{poplar1-const}}.

### Client

The client's input is an IDPF index, denoted `alpha`. The programmed IDPF values
are pairs of field elements `(1, k)` where each `k` is chosen at random. This
random value is used as part of the secure sketching protocol of {{BBCGGI21}},
Appendix C.4. After evaluating their IDPF key shares on a given sequence of
candidate prefixes, the sketching protocol is used by the Aggregators to verify
that they hold shares of a one-hot vector. In addition, for each level of the
tree, the prover generates random elements `a`, `b`, and `c` and computes

~~~
    A = -2*a + k
    B = a^2 + b - k*a + c
~~~

and sends additive shares of `a`, `b`, `c`, `A` and `B` to the Aggregators.
Putting everything together, the input-distribution algorithm is defined as
follows. Function `encode_input_shares` is defined in {{poplar1-auxiliary}}.

### Preparation

The aggregation parameter encodes a sequence of candidate prefixes. When an
Aggregator receives an input share from the Client, it begins by evaluating its
IDPF share on each candidate prefix, recovering a `data_share` and `auth_share`
for each. The Aggregators use these and the correlation shares provided by the
Client to verify that the sequence of `data_share` values are additive shares of
a one-hot vector.

Aggregators MUST ensure the candidate prefixes are all unique and appear in
lexicographic order. (This is enforced in the definition of `prep_init()`
below.) Uniqueness is necessary to ensure the refined measurement (i.e., the sum
of the output shares) is in fact a one-hot vector. Otherwise, sketch
verification might fail, causing the Aggregators to erroneously reject a report
that is actually valid. Note that enforcing the order is not strictly necessary,
but this does allow uniqueness to be determined more efficiently.

The algorithms below make use of the auxiliary function `decode_input_share()`
defined in {{poplar1-auxiliary}}.

shares.

### Auxiliary Functions {#poplar1-auxiliary}

#### Message Serialization

This section defines methods for serializing input shares, as required by the
`Vdaf` interface. Optional serialization of the aggregation parameter is also
specified below.

Implementation note: The aggregation parameter includes the level of the IDPF
tree and the sequence of indices to evaluate. For implementations that perform
per-report caching across executions of the VDAF, this may be more information
than is strictly needed. In particular, it may be sufficient to convey which
indices from the previous execution will have their children included in the
next. This would help reduce communication overhead.

## The IDPF scheme of {{BBCGGI21}} {#idpf-poplar}

In this section we specify a concrete IDPF, called IdpfPoplar, suitable for
instantiating Poplar1. The scheme gets its name from the name of the protocol of
{{BBCGGI21}}.

> TODO We should consider giving `IdpfPoplar` a more distinctive name.

The constant and type definitions required by the `Idpf` interface are given in

## Instantiation {#poplar1-inst}

By default, Poplar1 is instantiated with IdpfPoplar (`VALUE_LEN == 2`) and
PrgSha3 ({{prg-sha3}}). This VDAF is suitable for any positive value of `BITS`.
Test vectors can be found in {{test-vectors}}.

# Security Considerations {#security}

> NOTE: This is a brief outline of the security considerations.  This section
> will be filled out more as the draft matures and security analyses are
> completed.

VDAFs have two essential security goals:

1. Privacy: An attacker that controls the network, the Collector, and a subset
   of Clients and Aggregators learns nothing about the measurements of honest
   Clients beyond what it can deduce from the aggregate result.

1. Robustness: An attacker that controls the network and a subset of Clients
   cannot cause the Collector to compute anything other than the aggregate of
   the measurements of honest Clients.

Note that, to achieve robustness, it is important to ensure that the
verification key distributed to the Aggregators (`verify_key`, see {{sec-vdaf-prepare}}) is
never revealed to the Clients.

It is also possible to consider a stronger form of robustness, where the
attacker also controls a subset of Aggregators (see {{BBCGGI19}}, Section 6.3).
To satisfy this stronger notion of robustness, it is necessary to prevent the
attacker from sharing the verification key with the Clients. It is therefore
RECOMMENDED that the Aggregators generate `verify_key` only after a set of
Client inputs has been collected for verification, and re-generate them for each
such set of inputs.

A VDAF is the core cryptographic primitive of a protocol that achieves
the above privacy and robustness goals. It is not sufficient on its own,
however. The application will need to assure a few security properties,
for example:

* Securely distributing the long-lived parameters.
* Establishing secure channels:
  * Confidential and authentic channels among Aggregators, and between the
    Aggregators and the Collector; and
  * Confidential and Aggregator-authenticated channels between Clients and
    Aggregators.
* Enforcing the non-collusion properties required of the specific VDAF in use.

In such an environment, a VDAF provides the high-level privacy property
described above: The Collector learns only the aggregate measurement, and
nothing about individual measurements aside from what can be inferred from the
aggregate result.  The Aggregators learn neither individual measurements nor the
aggregate result.  The Collector is assured that the aggregate statistic
accurately reflects the inputs as long as the Aggregators correctly executed
their role in the VDAF.

On their own, VDAFs do not mitigate Sybil attacks {{Dou02}}. In this attack, the
adversary observes a subset of input shares transmitted by a Client it is
interested in. It allows the input shares to be processed, but corrupts and
picks bogus inputs for the remaining Clients.  Applications can guard against
these risks by adding additional controls on measurement submission, such as
client authentication and rate limits.

VDAFs do not inherently provide differential privacy {{Dwo06}}.  The VDAF approach
to private measurement can be viewed as complementary to differential privacy,
relying on non-collusion instead of statistical noise to protect the privacy of
the inputs.  It is possible that a future VDAF could incorporate differential
privacy features, e.g., by injecting noise before the sharding stage and
removing it after unsharding.

## Requirements for the Nonce

The sharding and preparation steps of VDAF execution depend on a nonce
associated with the Client's report. To ensure privacy of the underlying
measurement, the Client MUST generate this nonce using a CSPRNG. This is
required in order to leverage security analysis for the privacy definition of
{{DPRS23}}, which assumes the nonce is chosen at random prior to generating the
report.

Other security considerations may require the nonce to be non-repeating. For
example, to achieve differential privacy it is necessary to avoid "over
exposing" a measurement by including it too many times in a single batch or
across multiple batches. It is RECOMMENDED that the nonce generated by the
Client be used by the Aggregators for replay protection.

# IANA Considerations

A codepoint for each (V)DAF in this document is defined in the table below. Note
that `0xFFFF0000` through `0xFFFFFFFF` are reserved for private use.

Test vectors cover the generation of input shares and the conversion of input
shares into output shares. Vectors specify the verification key, measurements,
aggregation parameter, and any parameters needed to construct the VDAF. (For
example, for `Prio3Aes128Sum`, the user specifies the number of bits for
representing each summand.)

Byte strings are encoded in hexadecimal To make the tests deterministic,
`gen_rand()` was replaced with a function that returns the requested number of
`0x01` octets.
